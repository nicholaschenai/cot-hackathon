Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Ten more than five times a number equals five more than ten times the number. What is the number?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let the number be \( x \).

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[
5x + 10 = 10x + 5
\]

## Step 1: Rearranging the equation
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[
10 = 10x - 5x + 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
10 = 5x + 5
\]

## Step 2: Isolating \( x \)
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
10 - 5 = 5x
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5 = 5x
\]

## Step 3: Solving for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 1
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1}\). I hope it is correct.
