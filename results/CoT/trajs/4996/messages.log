The matrix for projecting onto a certain plane $P,$ which passes through the origin, is given by
\[\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{13}{14} & -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{3}{14} \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{5}{7} & \frac{3}{7} \\ \frac{3}{14} & \frac{3}{7} & \frac{5}{14} \end{pmatrix} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}.\]Find the normal vector of plane $P.$  Enter your answer in the form $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are integers, $a > 0,$ and $\gcd(|a|,|b|,|c|) = 1.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the normal vector of the plane \( P \) given the projection matrix \( M \), we can use the property that the projection matrix onto a plane can be expressed as:

\[
M = I - \frac{n n^T}{\|n\|^2}
\]

where \( n \) is the normal vector to the plane, and \( I \) is the identity matrix.

## Step 1: Identify the normal vector
The projection matrix \( M \) can be rewritten as:

\[
M = I - P
\]

where \( P \) is the matrix formed by the outer product of the normal vector \( n \) with itself, normalized by the square of its norm. The normal vector can be found by determining the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of the matrix \( M \).

## Step 2: Calculate the eigenvalues of \( M \)
To find the eigenvalues, we compute the characteristic polynomial \( \det(M - \lambda I) = 0 \).

Calculating \( M - \lambda I \):

\[
M - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{13}{14} - \lambda & -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{3}{14} \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{5}{7} - \lambda & \frac{3}{7} \\ \frac{3}{14} & \frac{3}{7} & \frac{5}{14} - \lambda \end{pmatrix}
\]

Setting the determinant to zero will yield the eigenvalues. However, we can also find the normal vector directly by observing that the projection matrix \( M \) has a rank of 2 (since it projects onto a plane), which implies that there is one eigenvalue equal to 0.

## Step 3: Find the null space of \( M \)
To find the normal vector, we solve \( M \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = 0 \).

Calculating \( M \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{13}{14} & -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{3}{14} \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{5}{7} & \frac{3}{7} \\ \frac{3}{14} & \frac{3}{7} & \frac{5}{14} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \( \frac{13}{14}x - \frac{1}{7}y + \frac{3}{14}z = 0 \)
2. \( -\frac{1}{7}x + \frac{5}{7}y + \frac{3}{7}z = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{3}{14}x + \frac{3}{7}y + \frac{5}{14}z = 0 \)

## Step 4: Solve the system
We can simplify the equations. From the first equation, multiply through by 14:

\[
13x - 2y + 3z = 0 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

From the second equation, multiply through by 7:

\[
-x + 5y + 3z = 0 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

From the third equation, multiply through by 14:

\[
3x + 6y + 5z = 0 \quad \text{(3)}
\]

Now we can solve these equations. From (1), express \( z \):

\[
z = -\frac{13}{3}x + \frac{2}{3}y
\]

Substituting \( z \) into (2) and (3) will yield a consistent system. After solving, we find that the normal vector can be expressed as:

\[
n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

## Step 5: Normalize the vector
To ensure \( a > 0 \) and \( \gcd(|a|, |b|, |c|) = 1 \), we check:

\[
\gcd(1, 2, 3) = 1
\]

Thus, the normal vector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}}\). I hope it is correct.
