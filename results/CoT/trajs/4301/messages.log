The length of a rectangle is twice its width. Given the length of the diagonal is $5\sqrt{5}$, find the area of the rectangle.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Define the dimensions
Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \). Then, the length \( l \) is given by:
\[
l = 2w
\]

## Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem
The diagonal \( d \) of the rectangle can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
5\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{(2w)^2 + w^2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{4w^2 + w^2} = \sqrt{5w^2}
\]

## Step 3: Solve for \( w \)
Squaring both sides gives:
\[
(5\sqrt{5})^2 = 5w^2
\]
\[
125 = 5w^2
\]
Dividing both sides by 5:
\[
w^2 = 25
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
w = 5
\]

## Step 4: Find the length
Now, substituting back to find the length:
\[
l = 2w = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

## Step 5: Calculate the area
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = l \times w = 10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{50}\). I hope it is correct.
