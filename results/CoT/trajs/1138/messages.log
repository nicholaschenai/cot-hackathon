The graph of $y=ax^2+bx+c$ passes through points $(0,5)$, $(1,10)$, and $(2,19)$. Find $a+b+c$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Set up the equations
Using the points given, we can create a system of equations based on the quadratic function \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\).

1. For the point \((0, 5)\):
   \[
   c = 5
   \]

2. For the point \((1, 10)\):
   \[
   a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 10 \implies a + b + 5 = 10 \implies a + b = 5
   \]

3. For the point \((2, 19)\):
   \[
   a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 19 \implies 4a + 2b + 5 = 19 \implies 4a + 2b = 14 \implies 2a + b = 7
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + b = 5\)
2. \(2a + b = 7\)

## Step 2: Solve the system of equations
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2a + b) - (a + b) = 7 - 5 \implies a = 2
\]

Substituting \(a = 2\) back into the first equation:
\[
2 + b = 5 \implies b = 3
\]

## Step 3: Find \(a + b + c\)
Now we have:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = 3\)
- \(c = 5\)

Calculating \(a + b + c\):
\[
a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{10}\). I hope it is correct.
