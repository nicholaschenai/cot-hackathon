Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\$1$ and one ball labeled $\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\$8$ and one ball labeled $\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the expected win, we will calculate the expected value based on the outcomes from bins \( A \), \( B \), and \( W \).

## Step 1: Calculate the probabilities from bin \( A \)
- Probability of selecting a white ball from bin \( A \): 
  \[
  P(\text{White}) = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
- Probability of selecting a black ball from bin \( A \): 
  \[
  P(\text{Black}) = \frac{4}{5}
  \]

## Step 2: Calculate the expected win if a white ball is selected
If a white ball is selected, we choose from bin \( W \):
- The values in bin \( W \) are five balls labeled \$8 and one ball labeled \$500.
- The expected value from bin \( W \):
  \[
  E(W) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \times 8 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{6} \times 500 \right) = \frac{40}{6} + \frac{500}{6} = \frac{540}{6} = 90
  \]

## Step 3: Calculate the expected win if a black ball is selected
If a black ball is selected, we choose from bin \( B \):
- The values in bin \( B \) are three balls labeled \$1 and one ball labeled \$7.
- The expected value from bin \( B \):
  \[
  E(B) = \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 1 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 7 \right) = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{7}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
  \]

## Step 4: Combine the expected values based on the probabilities from bin \( A \)
Now we combine the expected values based on the probabilities of selecting a white or black ball:
\[
E(\text{Total}) = P(\text{White}) \times E(W) + P(\text{Black}) \times E(B)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E(\text{Total}) = \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 90 \right) + \left( \frac{4}{5} \times 2.5 \right)
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
E(\text{Total}) = \frac{90}{5} + \frac{10}{5} = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.
