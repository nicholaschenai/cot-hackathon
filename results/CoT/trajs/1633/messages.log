How many multiples of $9^3$ are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the range
We need to find multiples of \(9^3\) that are greater than \(9^4\) and less than \(9^5\). 

## Step 2: Express the multiples
The multiples of \(9^3\) can be expressed as \(k \cdot 9^3\) where \(k\) is a positive integer. We need to find \(k\) such that:
\[
9^4 < k \cdot 9^3 < 9^5
\]

## Step 3: Simplify the inequalities
Dividing the entire inequality by \(9^3\):
\[
9 < k < 9
\]

## Step 4: Determine the integer values of \(k\)
The inequality \(9 < k < 9\) has no integer solutions since \(k\) cannot be both greater than and less than \(9\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{0}\). I hope it is correct.
