================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we will first establish the coordinates of the points in rectangle \(ABCD\) and then find the intersection point \(G\) and the length of \(GF\).

## Step 1: Establish coordinates
Let:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (8, 0)\)
- \(C = (8, 9)\)
- \(D = (0, 9)\)

Point \(H\) is on \(\overline{BC}\) such that \(BH = 6\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(H\) are:
\[
H = (8, 6)
\]

Point \(E\) is on \(\overline{AD}\) such that \(DE = 4\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(E\) are:
\[
E = (0, 5)
\]

## Step 2: Find the equations of lines \(EC\) and \(AH\)
The slope of line \(EC\) (from \(E\) to \(C\)) is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{slope of } EC = \frac{9 - 5}{8 - 0} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Using point-slope form, the equation of line \(EC\) is:
\[
y - 5 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + 5
\]

The slope of line \(AH\) (from \(A\) to \(H\)) is:
\[
\text{slope of } AH = \frac{6 - 0}{8 - 0} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
\]
Using point-slope form, the equation of line \(AH\) is:
\[
y - 0 = \frac{3}{4}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

## Step 3: Find the intersection point \(G\)
To find point \(G\), we set the equations of lines \(EC\) and \(AH\) equal to each other:
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + 5 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]
Multiplying through by 4 to eliminate the fractions:
\[
2x + 20 = 3x \implies 20 = x \implies x = 20
\]
Substituting \(x = 20\) back into the equation of line \(AH\) to find \(y\):
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}(20) = 15
\]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(G\) are:
\[
G = (20, 15)
\]

## Step 4: Find the coordinates of point \(F\)
Point \(F\) lies on line \(AD\) (which is vertical at \(x = 0\)). Since \(\overline{GF} \perp \overline{AF}\), the slope of line \(GF\) must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of line \(AF\).

The slope of line \(AF\) (from \(A\) to \(F\)) is:
\[
\text{slope of } AF = \frac{y_F - 0}{0 - 0} \text{ (undefined, vertical)}
\]
Thus, line \(GF\) is horizontal, meaning \(y_F = 15\). Therefore, the coordinates of point \(F\) are:
\[
F = (0, 15)
\]

## Step 5: Calculate the length \(\overline{GF}\)
The length of \(\overline{GF}\) is the vertical distance between points \(G\) and \(F\):
\[
GF = |y_G - y_F| = |15 - 15| = 0
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{0}\). I hope it is correct.
