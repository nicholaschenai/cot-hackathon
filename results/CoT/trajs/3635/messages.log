What is the least common multiple of 72 and 96?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Find the prime factorization
- The prime factorization of 72 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \).
- The prime factorization of 96 is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \).

## Step 2: Determine the highest powers of each prime
- For the prime \( 2 \), the highest power is \( 2^5 \).
- For the prime \( 3 \), the highest power is \( 3^2 \).

## Step 3: Calculate the least common multiple
- The least common multiple (LCM) is found by multiplying the highest powers of all primes:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^5 \times 3^2 = 32 \times 9 = 288.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{288}$. I hope it is correct.
