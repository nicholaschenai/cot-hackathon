A fraction is equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}.$ Its denominator and numerator add up to $91.$ What is the difference between the denominator and numerator of this fraction?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Set up the equations
Let the numerator be \( x \) and the denominator be \( y \). We know:
1. \( \frac{x}{y} = \frac{5}{8} \)
2. \( x + y = 91 \)

## Step 2: Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \)
From the first equation, we can express \( x \) as:
\[
x = \frac{5}{8}y
\]

## Step 3: Substitute into the second equation
Substituting \( x \) into the second equation gives:
\[
\frac{5}{8}y + y = 91
\]
Combining the terms:
\[
\frac{5}{8}y + \frac{8}{8}y = 91 \implies \frac{13}{8}y = 91
\]

## Step 4: Solve for \( y \)
Multiplying both sides by \( \frac{8}{13} \):
\[
y = 91 \cdot \frac{8}{13} = 56
\]

## Step 5: Find \( x \)
Now substitute \( y \) back to find \( x \):
\[
x = 91 - y = 91 - 56 = 35
\]

## Step 6: Calculate the difference
The difference between the denominator and numerator is:
\[
y - x = 56 - 35 = 21
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.
