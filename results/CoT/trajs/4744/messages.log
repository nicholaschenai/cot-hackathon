Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

A curve is parameterized by
\[(x,y) = (t^3 + 7, -3t^2 - 6t - 5).\]Find the point the curve passes through at $t = 2.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate \( x \) at \( t = 2 \)
Substituting \( t = 2 \) into the equation for \( x \):
\[
x = t^3 + 7 = 2^3 + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15.
\]

## Step 2: Calculate \( y \) at \( t = 2 \)
Substituting \( t = 2 \) into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = -3t^2 - 6t - 5 = -3(2^2) - 6(2) - 5 = -3(4) - 12 - 5 = -12 - 12 - 5 = -29.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{(15, -29)}\). I hope it is correct.
