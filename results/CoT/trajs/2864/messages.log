A rectangular box has volume 216.  Find the smallest possible surface area of the box.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To minimize the surface area of a rectangular box with a fixed volume, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the AM-GM inequality. Here, we'll use the AM-GM inequality for simplicity.

## Step 1: Define the variables
Let the dimensions of the box be \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). The volume constraint is given by:
\[
xyz = 216
\]

## Step 2: Express the surface area
The surface area \( S \) of the box is given by:
\[
S = 2(xy + xz + yz)
\]

## Step 3: Apply the AM-GM inequality
Using the AM-GM inequality on the terms \( xy \), \( xz \), and \( yz \):
\[
\frac{xy + xz + yz}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(xyz)^2}
\]
Substituting \( xyz = 216 \):
\[
\frac{xy + xz + yz}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{216^2} = \sqrt[3]{46656} = 36
\]
Thus,
\[
xy + xz + yz \geq 108
\]
Therefore, the minimum surface area is:
\[
S \geq 2 \times 108 = 216
\]

## Step 4: Check if the minimum is achievable
The equality in AM-GM holds when \( xy = xz = yz \). This occurs when \( x = y = z \). Let \( x = y = z = a \):
\[
a^3 = 216 \implies a = 6
\]
Thus, the dimensions are \( 6 \times 6 \times 6 \).

## Step 5: Calculate the surface area
The surface area for these dimensions is:
\[
S = 2(6 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 6) = 2(36 + 36 + 36) = 2 \times 108 = 216
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{216}$. I hope it is correct.
