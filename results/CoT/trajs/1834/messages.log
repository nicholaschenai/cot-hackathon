A chord of a circle is perpendicular to a radius at the midpoint of the radius. The ratio of the area of the larger of the two regions into which the chord divides the circle to the smaller can be expressed in the form $\displaystyle
{{a\pi+b\sqrt{c}}\over{d\pi-e\sqrt{f}}}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are positive integers, $a$ and $e$ are relatively prime, and neither $c$ nor $f$ is divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the remainder when the product $a\cdot
b\cdot c\cdot d\cdot e\cdot f$ is divided by 1000.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let the radius of the circle be \( r \). The chord is perpendicular to the radius at its midpoint, which means the distance from the center of the circle to the chord is \( \frac{r}{2} \).

## Step 1: Calculate the length of the chord
Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance from the center to the chord, and half the length of the chord, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{L}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{r}{2}\right)^2 = r^2
\]

Let \( L \) be the length of the chord. Then:

\[
\frac{L^2}{4} + \frac{r^2}{4} = r^2
\]

Multiplying through by 4 gives:

\[
L^2 + r^2 = 4r^2
\]

Thus,

\[
L^2 = 3r^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = r\sqrt{3}
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the circle and the area of the segment
The area of the entire circle is:

\[
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
\]

Next, we find the area of the segment formed by the chord. The angle \( \theta \) subtended by the chord at the center can be found using the cosine rule:

\[
\cos(\theta/2) = \frac{\frac{r}{2}}{r} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta/2 = \frac{\pi}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the sector corresponding to this angle is:

\[
A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot A_{\text{circle}} = \frac{\frac{2\pi}{3}}{2\pi} \cdot \pi r^2 = \frac{r^2}{3}
\]

The area of the triangle formed by the two radii and the chord is:

\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot r \cdot r \cdot \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{r^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Thus, the area of the segment is:

\[
A_{\text{segment}} = A_{\text{sector}} - A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{r^2}{3} - \frac{r^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

Finding a common denominator (12):

\[
A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{4r^2}{12} - \frac{3r^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{4r^2 - 3r^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{r^2(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{12}
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the areas of the two regions
The area of the larger region is:

\[
A_{\text{larger}} = A_{\text{circle}} - A_{\text{segment}} = \pi r^2 - \frac{r^2(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{12}
\]

The area of the smaller region is:

\[
A_{\text{smaller}} = A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{r^2(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{12}
\]

## Step 4: Find the ratio of the areas
The ratio of the area of the larger region to the smaller region is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{\text{larger}}}{A_{\text{smaller}}} = \frac{\pi r^2 - \frac{r^2(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{12}}{\frac{r^2(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{12}}
\]

Factoring out \( r^2 \):

\[
= \frac{12\pi - (4 - 3\sqrt{3})}{4 - 3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{12\pi - 4 + 3\sqrt{3}}{4 - 3\sqrt{3}}
\]

## Step 5: Simplify the ratio
This can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{(12\pi - 4 + 3\sqrt{3})}{(4 - 3\sqrt{3})}
\]

Identifying \( a = 12 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 3 \), \( d = 1 \), \( e = 3 \), \( f = 3 \).

## Final Calculation
Now, we compute the product:

\[
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot e \cdot f = 12 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 324
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when \( 324 \) is divided by \( 1000 \):

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{324}\). I hope it is correct.
