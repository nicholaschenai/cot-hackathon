A state had three letters followed by three digits as the format for license plates. In order to increase the number of plates available, the state changed the format to four letters followed by two digits. What is the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate the number of plates in the old format
The old format consists of 3 letters followed by 3 digits. 

- The number of choices for letters (A-Z) is 26.
- The number of choices for digits (0-9) is 10.

Thus, the total number of plates in the old format is:
\[
26^3 \times 10^3
\]

Calculating this:
\[
26^3 = 17576 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^3 = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Total for old format} = 17576 \times 1000 = 17576000
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the number of plates in the new format
The new format consists of 4 letters followed by 2 digits.

- The number of choices for letters is still 26.
- The number of choices for digits is still 10.

Thus, the total number of plates in the new format is:
\[
26^4 \times 10^2
\]

Calculating this:
\[
26^4 = 456976 \quad \text{and} \quad 10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\text{Total for new format} = 456976 \times 100 = 45697600
\]

## Step 3: Find the positive difference between the two formats
Now, we find the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the old format:
\[
\text{Difference} = 45697600 - 17576000
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\text{Difference} = 28121600
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{28121600}$. I hope it is correct.
