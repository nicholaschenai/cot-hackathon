Simplify $\sqrt{64^3}$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To simplify \(\sqrt{64^3}\), we can rewrite it as follows:

\[
\sqrt{64^3} = (64^3)^{1/2} = 64^{3/2}
\]

Next, we can express \(64\) as \(8^2\):

\[
64^{3/2} = (8^2)^{3/2} = 8^{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = 8^3
\]

Now, we calculate \(8^3\):

\[
8^3 = 512
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{512}\). I hope it is correct.
