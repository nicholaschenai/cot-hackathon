What is the product of all constants $k$ such that the quadratic $x^2 + kx +15$ can be factored in the form $(x+a)(x+b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the product of all constants \( k \) such that the quadratic \( x^2 + kx + 15 \) can be factored in the form \( (x + a)(x + b) \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, we start by recognizing that:

\[
x^2 + kx + 15 = (x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab
\]

From this, we can equate coefficients:

1. \( k = a + b \)
2. \( ab = 15 \)

Next, we need to find all pairs of integers \( (a, b) \) such that their product \( ab = 15 \). The integer pairs \( (a, b) \) that satisfy this condition are:

- \( (1, 15) \)
- \( (15, 1) \)
- \( (3, 5) \)
- \( (5, 3) \)
- \( (-1, -15) \)
- \( (-15, -1) \)
- \( (-3, -5) \)
- \( (-5, -3) \)

Now, we calculate \( k = a + b \) for each pair:

- For \( (1, 15) \): \( k = 1 + 15 = 16 \)
- For \( (15, 1) \): \( k = 15 + 1 = 16 \)
- For \( (3, 5) \): \( k = 3 + 5 = 8 \)
- For \( (5, 3) \): \( k = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
- For \( (-1, -15) \): \( k = -1 - 15 = -16 \)
- For \( (-15, -1) \): \( k = -15 - 1 = -16 \)
- For \( (-3, -5) \): \( k = -3 - 5 = -8 \)
- For \( (-5, -3) \): \( k = -5 - 3 = -8 \)

The distinct values of \( k \) are \( 16, 8, -16, -8 \).

Next, we find the product of these distinct values:

\[
16 \times 8 \times (-16) \times (-8)
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( 16 \times 8 = 128 \)
2. \( -16 \times -8 = 128 \)
3. \( 128 \times 128 = 16384 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: 

\[
\boxed{16384}
\] 

I hope it is correct.
