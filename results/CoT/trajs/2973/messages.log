How many ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ of rational numbers are there where $a,b,c$ are the roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the number of ordered triplets \((a,b,c)\) of rational numbers such that \(a,b,c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), we can use Vieta's formulas.

## Step 1: Apply Vieta's Formulas
From Vieta's formulas, we know that for a cubic polynomial \(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0\) with roots \(r_1, r_2, r_3\):
- \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -p\)
- \(r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = q\)
- \(r_1 r_2 r_3 = -r\)

In our case, the roots are \(a, b, c\), and the polynomial is \(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Thus, we have:
- \(a + b + c = -a\)
- \(ab + ac + bc = b\)
- \(abc = -c\)

## Step 2: Rearranging the Equations
From the first equation:
\[
a + b + c = -a \implies 2a + b + c = 0 \implies b + c = -2a
\]

From the second equation:
\[
ab + ac + bc = b \implies ab + ac + (-2a) = b \implies ab + ac - 2a = b \implies ab + ac = b + 2a
\]

From the third equation:
\[
abc = -c \implies abc + c = 0 \implies c(ab + 1) = 0
\]

## Step 3: Analyzing the Cases
1. **Case 1**: \(c = 0\)
   - Then \(b = -2a\).
   - The roots are \(a, -2a, 0\).
   - For any rational \(a\), we can choose \(a\) freely, leading to infinitely many rational triplets.

2. **Case 2**: \(ab + 1 = 0\) (i.e., \(ab = -1\))
   - This gives \(b = -\frac{1}{a}\).
   - Substituting into \(b + c = -2a\):
     \[
     -\frac{1}{a} + c = -2a \implies c = -2a + \frac{1}{a}
     \]
   - Thus, we have \(a, -\frac{1}{a}, -2a + \frac{1}{a}\).
   - For any rational \(a\) (except \(a = 0\)), we can choose \(a\) freely, leading to infinitely many rational triplets.

## Conclusion
In both cases, we find that there are infinitely many ordered triplets \((a, b, c)\) of rational numbers satisfying the given polynomial condition.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\infty}\). I hope it is correct.
