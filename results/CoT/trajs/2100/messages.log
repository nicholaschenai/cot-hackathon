A cubic block of wood with side lengths of 10 cm is cut into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 cm. What is the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood? Express your answer as a common fraction.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate the surface area of the larger block
The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[
A = 6s^2
\]
For the larger block with side length \( s = 10 \) cm:
\[
A = 6(10^2) = 6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ cm}^2
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the number of smaller cubes
The larger block is cut into smaller cubes with side length \( 1 \) cm. The number of smaller cubes is:
\[
\text{Number of cubes} = \left(\frac{10}{1}\right)^3 = 10^3 = 1000
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the surface area of the smaller cubes
The surface area of one smaller cube is:
\[
A_{\text{small}} = 6(1^2) = 6 \text{ cm}^2
\]
Thus, the combined surface area of all smaller cubes is:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = 1000 \times 6 = 6000 \text{ cm}^2
\]

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the surface areas
The ratio of the surface area of the larger block to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{600}{6000} = \frac{1}{10}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$. I hope it is correct.
