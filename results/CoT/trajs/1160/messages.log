For how many values of $x$ is the function $y=\frac{x-2}{x^2-7x+10}$ not defined?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine for how many values of \( x \) the function \( y = \frac{x-2}{x^2 - 7x + 10} \) is not defined, we need to find when the denominator is equal to zero.

## Step 1: Set the denominator to zero
We start with the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0
\]

## Step 2: Factor the quadratic
Next, we factor the quadratic:
\[
x^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 2)(x - 5)
\]

## Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Setting each factor to zero gives us:
\[
x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
\]
\[
x - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 5
\]

Thus, the function is not defined for \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 5 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{2}\). I hope it is correct.
