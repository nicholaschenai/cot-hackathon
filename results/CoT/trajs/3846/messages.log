Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the prime factors of 28
The prime factorization of 28 is:
\[
28 = 2^2 \times 7
\]
This means that any number that is relatively prime to 28 must not be divisible by 2 or 7.

## Step 2: List the integers between 10 and 30
The integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are:
\[
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
\]

## Step 3: Count the integers that are not divisible by 2 or 7
We will check each number:

- 11: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 12: divisible by 2
- 13: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 14: divisible by 2 and 7
- 15: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 16: divisible by 2
- 17: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 18: divisible by 2
- 19: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 20: divisible by 2
- 21: divisible by 7
- 22: divisible by 2
- 23: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 24: divisible by 2
- 25: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 26: divisible by 2
- 27: not divisible by 2 or 7
- 28: divisible by 2 and 7
- 29: not divisible by 2 or 7

The numbers that are relatively prime to 28 are:
\[
11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29
\]

## Step 4: Count the relatively prime numbers
Counting these, we find there are 9 integers.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.
