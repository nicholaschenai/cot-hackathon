What is the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the smallest prime factors
The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We will use the first three primes: 2, 3, and 5.

## Step 2: Form a perfect square
To form a perfect square with three different prime factors, each prime must appear with an even exponent. The smallest perfect square with three different prime factors is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\).

## Step 3: Calculate the perfect square
Calculating this gives:
\[
2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 5^2 = 25
\]
Now, multiply these together:
\[
4 \times 9 = 36
\]
\[
36 \times 25 = 900
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{900}$. I hope it is correct.
