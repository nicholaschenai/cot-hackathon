Given 5 colors to choose from, how many ways can we color the four unit squares of a $2\times 2$ board, given that two colorings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other? (Note that we can use the same color for more than one square.)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem of coloring the four unit squares of a \(2 \times 2\) board with 5 colors, considering rotations as identical, we can use Burnside's lemma.

## Step 1: Identify the symmetries
The \(2 \times 2\) board has 4 rotational symmetries:
1. \(0^\circ\) (identity)
2. \(90^\circ\) clockwise
3. \(180^\circ\)
4. \(270^\circ\) clockwise

## Step 2: Count colorings fixed by each symmetry
- **Identity (0° rotation)**: All colorings are fixed. Each square can be any of the 5 colors, so the total is:
  \[
  5^4 = 625
  \]

- **90° rotation**: For a coloring to be fixed, all squares must be the same color (since each square moves to another square). Thus, there are:
  \[
  5 \text{ (one for each color)}
  \]

- **180° rotation**: The top left square must match the bottom right square, and the top right square must match the bottom left square. Thus, we can choose 2 colors independently:
  \[
  5 \text{ (for top left and bottom right)} \times 5 \text{ (for top right and bottom left)} = 5^2 = 25
  \]

- **270° rotation**: Similar to the 90° rotation, all squares must be the same color. Thus, there are:
  \[
  5 \text{ (one for each color)}
  \]

## Step 3: Apply Burnside's lemma
Burnside's lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry. We sum the fixed colorings and divide by the number of symmetries:
\[
\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \frac{1}{4} (625 + 5 + 25 + 5) = \frac{1}{4} (660) = 165
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{165}\). I hope it is correct.
