What is the sum of all integer values of $x$ such that $\frac{3}{x}$ is greater than $\frac{1}{3}$ and less than $\frac{3}{4}$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Set up the inequalities
We need to solve the compound inequality:
\[
\frac{1}{3} < \frac{3}{x} < \frac{3}{4}
\]

## Step 2: Solve the left inequality
Starting with the left part:
\[
\frac{3}{x} > \frac{1}{3}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(3x\) (noting that \(x\) must be positive for the inequality to hold):
\[
9 > x \quad \text{(for } x > 0\text{)}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
x < 9
\]

For \(x < 0\), we multiply by \(3x\) (which reverses the inequality):
\[
9 < x \quad \text{(for } x < 0\text{)}
\]
This gives no valid solutions since \(x\) cannot be both less than 0 and greater than 9.

## Step 3: Solve the right inequality
Now, for the right part:
\[
\frac{3}{x} < \frac{3}{4}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(4x\) (again, noting that \(x\) must be positive):
\[
12 < 3x \implies 4 < x
\]

## Step 4: Combine the results
From the two inequalities, we have:
\[
4 < x < 9
\]
The integer values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality are \(5, 6, 7, 8\).

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the integer values
Now, we sum these integer values:
\[
5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{26}\). I hope it is correct.
