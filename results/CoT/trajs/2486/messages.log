A certain ellipse is defined by
\[PF_1 + PF_2 = d.\]The equation of the ellipse is $4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y - 8 = 0.$  Find $d.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find \( d \) for the given ellipse defined by the equation \( 4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y - 8 = 0 \), we will first rewrite the equation in standard form.

## Step 1: Rearranging the equation
We start by rearranging the equation:
\[
4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 8.
\]

## Step 2: Completing the square
Next, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For \( x \):
\[
4(x^2 - 2x) = 4((x - 1)^2 - 1) = 4(x - 1)^2 - 4.
\]

For \( y \):
\[
y^2 + 4y = (y + 2)^2 - 4.
\]

Substituting these back into the equation gives:
\[
4((x - 1)^2 - 1) + ((y + 2)^2 - 4) = 8.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4(x - 1)^2 - 4 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 = 8,
\]
which further simplifies to:
\[
4(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 16.
\]

## Step 3: Dividing by 16
Dividing the entire equation by 16, we obtain:
\[
\frac{(x - 1)^2}{4} + \frac{(y + 2)^2}{16} = 1.
\]

This is the standard form of the ellipse, where \( a^2 = 4 \) and \( b^2 = 16 \). Thus, \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \).

## Step 4: Finding the distance \( d \)
The distance \( d \) is given by the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci, which is equal to \( 2a \):
\[
d = 2a = 2 \times 2 = 4.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\). I hope it is correct.
