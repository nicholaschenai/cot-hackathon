Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \)
From the first equation \( 3x + y = 17 \), we can express \( y \) as:
\[
y = 17 - 3x
\]

## Step 2: Substitute \( y \) into the second equation
Substituting \( y \) into the second equation \( 5y + z = 14 \):
\[
5(17 - 3x) + z = 14
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
85 - 15x + z = 14
\]
Rearranging to solve for \( z \):
\[
z = 14 - 85 + 15x = 15x - 71
\]

## Step 3: Substitute \( z \) into the third equation
Now substitute \( z \) into the third equation \( 3x + 5z = 41 \):
\[
3x + 5(15x - 71) = 41
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
3x + 75x - 355 = 41
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
78x - 355 = 41
\]
Adding 355 to both sides:
\[
78x = 396
\]
Dividing by 78:
\[
x = \frac{396}{78} = 5.076923 \text{ (approximately)}
\]

## Step 4: Calculate \( y \) and \( z \)
Using \( x \) to find \( y \):
\[
y = 17 - 3(5.076923) \approx 1.769231
\]
Using \( x \) to find \( z \):
\[
z = 15(5.076923) - 71 \approx 0.153846
\]

## Step 5: Calculate \( x + y + z \)
Now, we find the sum:
\[
x + y + z \approx 5.076923 + 1.769231 + 0.153846 \approx 7.999999 \text{ (approximately 8)}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.
