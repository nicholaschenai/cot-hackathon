## Step 1: Find the dimensions of the original rectangle
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
P = 2(l + w)
\]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width. Given that the perimeter is 176, we have:
\[
2(l + w) = 176
\]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
l + w = 88
\]

## Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the congruent rectangles
The original rectangle is divided into five congruent rectangles. Assuming the division is horizontal, each of the five rectangles will have the same width \( w \) and a height of \( \frac{l}{5} \).

## Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of one congruent rectangle
The perimeter \( P_r \) of one of the congruent rectangles is given by:
\[
P_r = 2\left(\frac{l}{5} + w\right)
\]
Substituting \( w = 88 - l \) into the equation:
\[
P_r = 2\left(\frac{l}{5} + (88 - l)\right)
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
P_r = 2\left(\frac{l}{5} + 88 - l\right) = 2\left(88 - \frac{4l}{5}\right)
\]
\[
P_r = 176 - \frac{8l}{5}
\]

To find \( l \), we can express \( w \) in terms of \( l \) and substitute back, but we can also find \( P_r \) directly by using the total perimeter.

Since the total perimeter is 176, and there are 5 congruent rectangles, the perimeter of one rectangle can be calculated as:
\[
P_r = \frac{176}{5} = 35.2
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{70}$. I hope it is correct.
