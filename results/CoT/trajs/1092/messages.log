The expression $x^2 + 18x - 63$ can be written in the form $(x - a)(x + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are both nonnegative real numbers. What is the value of $b$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To rewrite the expression \( x^2 + 18x - 63 \) in the form \( (x - a)(x + b) \), we will first complete the square.

## Step 1: Complete the square
We start with the quadratic expression:
\[
x^2 + 18x - 63
\]
To complete the square, we take the coefficient of \( x \), which is 18, divide it by 2 to get 9, and then square it to get 81. We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
x^2 + 18x + 81 - 81 - 63 = (x + 9)^2 - 144
\]

## Step 2: Factor the expression
Now we can factor the expression:
\[
(x + 9)^2 - 144 = (x + 9 - 12)(x + 9 + 12) = (x - 3)(x + 21)
\]

Here, we identify \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 21 \).

Since both \( a \) and \( b \) are nonnegative real numbers, we find that \( b = 21 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{21}\). I hope it is correct.
