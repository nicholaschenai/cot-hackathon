In $\triangle{XYZ}$, $\angle{Z}=90^{\circ}$, $\cos{Y}=\frac{7}{25}$, and $XY=25$.  What is $\tan{X}$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Find the lengths of the sides
In triangle \( XYZ \), since \( \angle Z = 90^\circ \), we can use the cosine definition. We know that:

\[
\cos Y = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{XZ}{XY}
\]

Given \( \cos Y = \frac{7}{25} \) and \( XY = 25 \):

\[
XZ = 25 \cdot \frac{7}{25} = 7
\]

Now, we can find \( YZ \) using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
XY^2 = XZ^2 + YZ^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
25^2 = 7^2 + YZ^2
\]
\[
625 = 49 + YZ^2
\]
\[
YZ^2 = 625 - 49 = 576
\]
\[
YZ = \sqrt{576} = 24
\]

## Step 2: Find \( \tan X \)
Now, we can find \( \tan X \):

\[
\tan X = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{YZ}{XZ} = \frac{24}{7}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{24}{7}}\). I hope it is correct.
