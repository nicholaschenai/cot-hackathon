Let $\boxed{N}$ mean the number of whole number divisors of $N$. For example, $\boxed{3}=2$, because $3$ has two divisors, $1$ and $3.$ Find the value of \[\boxed{\boxed{11}\times\boxed{20}}\]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we first need to find the number of whole number divisors for \(11\) and \(20\).

## Step 1: Find \(\boxed{11}\)
The number \(11\) is a prime number. The formula for the number of divisors \(d(n)\) of a prime number \(p\) is given by:
\[
d(p) = 2
\]
Thus, \(\boxed{11} = 2\).

## Step 2: Find \(\boxed{20}\)
Next, we find the number of divisors for \(20\). First, we factor \(20\):
\[
20 = 2^2 \times 5^1
\]
Using the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization:
\[
d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
\]
where \(e_i\) are the exponents in the prime factorization, we have:
\[
d(20) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]
Thus, \(\boxed{20} = 6\).

## Step 3: Calculate \(\boxed{11} \times \boxed{20}\)
Now we multiply the results from the previous steps:
\[
\boxed{11} \times \boxed{20} = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{12}\). I hope it is correct.
