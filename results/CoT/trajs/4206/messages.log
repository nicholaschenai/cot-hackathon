Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Solve for $k$ in the equation $2k+5 = 13$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Isolate the term with \( k \)
Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[
2k + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2k = 8
\]

## Step 2: Solve for \( k \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
k = \frac{8}{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
k = 4
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.
