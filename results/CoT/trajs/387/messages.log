The sum of three consecutive even integers is $66$. What is the smallest of the three integers?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Define the integers
Let the three consecutive even integers be \( x \), \( x + 2 \), and \( x + 4 \).

## Step 2: Set up the equation
The sum of these integers can be expressed as:
\[
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 66
\]

## Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[
3x + 6 = 66
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
3x = 60
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
x = 20
\]

Therefore, the smallest of the three integers is \( x = 20 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.
