Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the probability that three couples sit together in a socially optimal configuration, we can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Calculate the total arrangements of the six people.
The total number of ways to arrange 6 people in a row is given by the factorial of 6:
\[
6! = 720
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the arrangements where couples sit together.
We can treat each couple as a single unit or block. Thus, we have 3 blocks (couples) to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 3 blocks is:
\[
3! = 6
\]
Within each block, the two people can switch places, giving us \(2\) arrangements per couple. Therefore, for 3 couples, the arrangements are:
\[
2^3 = 8
\]
Thus, the total arrangements where couples sit together is:
\[
3! \times 2^3 = 6 \times 8 = 48
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the probability.
The probability that the couples sit together is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total arrangements:
\[
P(\text{couples together}) = \frac{48}{720} = \frac{1}{15}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}$. I hope it is correct.
