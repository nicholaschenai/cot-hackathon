The first 2007 positive integers are each written in base 3.  How many of these base-3 representations are palindromes?  (A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find how many of the first 2007 positive integers have palindromic representations in base 3, we will analyze the base-3 representations of these integers.

## Step 1: Determine the range of base-3 representations
First, we need to find the base-3 representation of 2007. We convert 2007 to base 3:

1. \( 3^0 = 1 \)
2. \( 3^1 = 3 \)
3. \( 3^2 = 9 \)
4. \( 3^3 = 27 \)
5. \( 3^4 = 81 \)
6. \( 3^5 = 243 \)
7. \( 3^6 = 729 \)
8. \( 3^7 = 2187 \) (too large)

Now, we calculate the coefficients for \( 3^6, 3^5, 3^4, 3^3, 3^2, 3^1, 3^0 \):

- \( 2007 \div 729 = 2 \) (remainder \( 549 \))
- \( 549 \div 243 = 2 \) (remainder \( 63 \))
- \( 63 \div 81 = 0 \) (remainder \( 63 \))
- \( 63 \div 27 = 2 \) (remainder \( 9 \))
- \( 9 \div 9 = 1 \) (remainder \( 0 \))
- \( 0 \div 3 = 0 \) (remainder \( 0 \))
- \( 0 \div 1 = 0 \) (remainder \( 0 \))

Thus, \( 2007 \) in base 3 is \( 2202120_3 \).

## Step 2: Count palindromic representations
Next, we need to count the palindromic numbers in base 3 from \( 1 \) to \( 2007 \) (or \( 2202120_3 \)).

### Length of base-3 numbers
The base-3 representations of numbers from \( 1 \) to \( 2007 \) can have lengths from \( 1 \) to \( 7 \) digits.

1. **1-digit palindromes**: \( 1, 2 \) (2 palindromes)
2. **2-digit palindromes**: \( 00, 11, 22 \) (3 palindromes, but only \( 11, 22 \) are valid since \( 00 \) is not positive)
3. **3-digit palindromes**: \( 101, 111, 121, 202, 212, 222 \) (6 palindromes)
4. **4-digit palindromes**: \( 1001, 1111, 1221, 2002, 2112, 2222 \) (6 palindromes)
5. **5-digit palindromes**: \( 10001, 10101, 10201, 11011, 11111, 11211, 12021, 12121, 12221, 20002, 20102, 20202, 21012, 21112, 21212, 22022 \) (15 palindromes)
6. **6-digit palindromes**: \( 100001, 100101, 100201, 101101, 101201, 102101, 110011, 110111, 111111, 112211, 120021, 120121, 121121, 200002, 200102, 200202, 201012, 201112, 202012, 210012, 210112, 211112, 220022, 220122, 221122, 222222 \) (25 palindromes)
7. **7-digit palindromes**: The maximum 7-digit number in base 3 is \( 2222222_3 \) which is \( 2186 \) in decimal. Since \( 2202120_3 \) is greater than \( 2186 \), we can count all 7-digit palindromes:
   - The form is \( a_0 a_1 a_2 a_2 a_1 a_0 \) where \( a_0 \) can be \( 1 \) or \( 2 \) (2 choices), \( a_1 \) can be \( 0, 1, 2 \) (3 choices), and \( a_2 \) can be \( 0, 1, 2 \) (3 choices).
   - Total: \( 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 18 \) palindromes.

### Total palindromes
Now, we sum the palindromes from each category:
- 1-digit: \( 2 \)
- 2-digit: \( 2 \)
- 3-digit: \( 6 \)
- 4-digit: \( 6 \)
- 5-digit: \( 15 \)
- 6-digit: \( 25 \)
- 7-digit: \( 18 \)

Total palindromes = \( 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 15 + 25 + 18 = 74 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{74}$. I hope it is correct.
