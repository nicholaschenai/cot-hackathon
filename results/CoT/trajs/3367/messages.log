Find the modulo 4 residue of $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Find the residues of each number modulo 4
We calculate the residues of 121, 122, and 123 modulo 4:

- \( 121 \mod 4 = 1 \) (since \( 121 = 4 \cdot 30 + 1 \))
- \( 122 \mod 4 = 2 \) (since \( 122 = 4 \cdot 30 + 2 \))
- \( 123 \mod 4 = 3 \) (since \( 123 = 4 \cdot 30 + 3 \))

## Step 2: Multiply the residues
Now we multiply the residues we found:

\[
1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]

## Step 3: Find the residue of the product modulo 4
Next, we find \( 6 \mod 4 \):

\[
6 \mod 4 = 2
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.
