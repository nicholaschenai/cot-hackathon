What is the sum of the digits when $527_{10}$ is converted to base 4?  (When you add the digits, express the sum in base 10.)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Convert \( 527_{10} \) to base 4
To convert \( 527 \) from base 10 to base 4, we repeatedly divide by 4 and keep track of the remainders.

1. \( 527 \div 4 = 131 \) remainder \( 3 \)
2. \( 131 \div 4 = 32 \) remainder \( 3 \)
3. \( 32 \div 4 = 8 \) remainder \( 0 \)
4. \( 8 \div 4 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)
5. \( 2 \div 4 = 0 \) remainder \( 2 \)

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that \( 527_{10} = 20033_4 \).

## Step 2: Sum the digits of \( 20033_4 \)
Now, we sum the digits of \( 20033_4 \):

\[
2 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{8}\). I hope it is correct.
