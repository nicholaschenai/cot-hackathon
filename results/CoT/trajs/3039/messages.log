For each real number $x$, let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the greatest integer that does not exceed $x$. For how many positive integers $n$ is it true that $n<1000$ and that $\lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor$ is a positive even integer?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we need to find the positive integers \( n < 1000 \) such that \( \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \) is a positive even integer.

## Step 1: Determine the range of \( n \) for even values of \( \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \)
Let \( k = \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \). Since \( k \) is a positive even integer, we can express \( k \) as \( k = 2m \) for some positive integer \( m \). The condition \( \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor = k \) implies:

\[
2m \leq \log_{2} n < 2m + 1
\]

Exponentiating gives:

\[
2^{2m} \leq n < 2^{2m + 1}
\]

## Step 2: Identify the valid values of \( m \)
We need to find the values of \( m \) such that \( n < 1000 \). Thus, we need:

\[
2^{2m + 1} > 1000
\]

Calculating \( 2^{10} = 1024 \), we find that \( 2^{2m + 1} \) must be at least \( 1024 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
2m + 1 \geq 10 \implies 2m \geq 9 \implies m \geq 5
\]

Now, we also need to find the maximum \( m \) such that \( 2^{2m} < 1000 \):

Calculating \( 2^9 = 512 \) and \( 2^{10} = 1024 \), we find:

\[
2m < 10 \implies m < 5
\]

Thus, \( m \) can take the values \( 5 \) (the minimum) and \( 6 \) (the maximum).

## Step 3: Calculate the ranges for valid \( n \)
1. For \( m = 5 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 5} = 2^{10} = 1024 \quad \text{(not valid since } n < 1000\text{)}
   \]

2. For \( m = 4 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 4} = 2^8 = 256 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{2 \cdot 4 + 1} = 2^9 = 512
   \]
   Thus, \( n \) can take values in the range \( 256 \leq n < 512 \).

3. For \( m = 3 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 3} = 2^6 = 64 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{2 \cdot 3 + 1} = 2^7 = 128
   \]
   Thus, \( n \) can take values in the range \( 64 \leq n < 128 \).

4. For \( m = 2 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 2} = 2^4 = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{2 \cdot 2 + 1} = 2^5 = 32
   \]
   Thus, \( n \) can take values in the range \( 16 \leq n < 32 \).

5. For \( m = 1 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 1} = 2^2 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{2 \cdot 1 + 1} = 2^3 = 8
   \]
   Thus, \( n \) can take values in the range \( 4 \leq n < 8 \).

6. For \( m = 0 \):
   \[
   2^{2 \cdot 0} = 2^0 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{2 \cdot 0 + 1} = 2^1 = 2
   \]
   Thus, \( n \) can take values in the range \( 1 \leq n < 2 \).

## Step 4: Count the valid integers in each range
- For \( m = 4 \): \( n = 256, 257, \ldots, 511 \) (256 values)
- For \( m = 3 \): \( n = 64, 65, \ldots, 127 \) (64 values)
- For \( m = 2 \): \( n = 16, 17, \ldots, 31 \) (16 values)
- For \( m = 1 \): \( n = 4, 5, 6, 7 \) (4 values)
- For \( m = 0 \): \( n = 1 \) (1 value)

Adding these counts gives:

\[
256 + 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 341
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{341}\). I hope it is correct.
