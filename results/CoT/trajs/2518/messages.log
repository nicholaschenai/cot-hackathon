To solve the system of equations, we start by rewriting each equation in a more manageable form.

## Step 1: Rewrite the equations
We can rearrange each equation to isolate the variable on one side:

1. From \(2y = x + \frac{17}{x}\), we have:
   \[
   2y - x = \frac{17}{x} \implies 2xy - x^2 = 17 \implies x^2 - 2xy + 17 = 0.
   \]

2. From \(2z = y + \frac{17}{y}\), we have:
   \[
   2z - y = \frac{17}{y} \implies 2zy - y^2 = 17 \implies y^2 - 2zy + 17 = 0.
   \]

3. From \(2w = z + \frac{17}{z}\), we have:
   \[
   2w - z = \frac{17}{z} \implies 2zw - z^2 = 17 \implies z^2 - 2zw + 17 = 0.
   \]

4. From \(2x = w + \frac{17}{w}\), we have:
   \[
   2x - w = \frac{17}{w} \implies 2wx - w^2 = 17 \implies w^2 - 2wx + 17 = 0.
   \]

## Step 2: Analyze the quadratic equations
Each of the equations we derived is a quadratic equation in the form \(t^2 - 2kt + 17 = 0\), where \(t\) is the variable and \(k\) is the corresponding variable from the previous equation.

The discriminant of a quadratic equation \(at^2 + bt + c = 0\) is given by \(D = b^2 - 4ac\). For our equations, the discriminant is:
\[
D = (-2k)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 17 = 4k^2 - 68.
\]

For the quadratic to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:
\[
4k^2 - 68 \geq 0 \implies 4k^2 \geq 68 \implies k^2 \geq 17 \implies |k| \geq \sqrt{17}.
\]

## Step 3: Determine the conditions for each variable
We need to find the values of \(x, y, z, w\) such that:
\[
|x| \geq \sqrt{17}, \quad |y| \geq \sqrt{17}, \quad |z| \geq \sqrt{17}, \quad |w| \geq \sqrt{17}.
\]

Each variable can take values in two intervals:
1. \(x \geq \sqrt{17}\)
2. \(x \leq -\sqrt{17}\)

The same applies for \(y, z, w\). Thus, each variable has 2 choices (positive or negative) if it satisfies the condition.

## Step 4: Count the combinations
Since there are 4 variables and each can independently take 2 values (either positive or negative), the total number of combinations of real solutions is:
\[
2^4 = 16.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{16}\). I hope it is correct.
