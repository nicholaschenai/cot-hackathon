Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Adina and Lynn are going rock-climbing and need to rent special shoes. Lynn is normally size 9 and knows that her rock-climbing shoe-size is 42. If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Establish the relationship
Since shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size, we can set up a ratio based on Lynn's sizes:
\[
\frac{\text{Lynn's normal size}}{\text{Lynn's climbing size}} = \frac{9}{42}
\]

## Step 2: Set up the proportion for Adina
Let \( x \) be Adina's rock-climbing shoe size. We can set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{\text{Adina's normal size}}{\text{Adina's climbing size}} = \frac{6}{x}
\]
Setting the two ratios equal gives us:
\[
\frac{9}{42} = \frac{6}{x}
\]

## Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
9x = 6 \times 42
\]
Calculating the right side:
\[
6 \times 42 = 252
\]
So,
\[
9x = 252
\]
Now, divide both sides by 9:
\[
x = \frac{252}{9} = 28
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.
