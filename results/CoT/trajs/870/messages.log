What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the minimum value of the expression \(2x^2 + 3y^2 + 8x - 24y + 62\), we can complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\).

## Step 1: Complete the square for \(x\)
The terms involving \(x\) are \(2x^2 + 8x\). We can factor out the 2:

\[
2(x^2 + 4x)
\]

Now, complete the square inside the parentheses:

\[
x^2 + 4x = (x + 2)^2 - 4
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
2(x^2 + 4x) = 2((x + 2)^2 - 4) = 2(x + 2)^2 - 8
\]

## Step 2: Complete the square for \(y\)
The terms involving \(y\) are \(3y^2 - 24y\). We can factor out the 3:

\[
3(y^2 - 8y)
\]

Now, complete the square inside the parentheses:

\[
y^2 - 8y = (y - 4)^2 - 16
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
3(y^2 - 8y) = 3((y - 4)^2 - 16) = 3(y - 4)^2 - 48
\]

## Step 3: Combine the completed squares
Now, substituting back into the original expression:

\[
2x^2 + 3y^2 + 8x - 24y + 62 = 2(x + 2)^2 - 8 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 48 + 62
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
= 2(x + 2)^2 + 3(y - 4)^2 + 6
\]

## Step 4: Find the minimum value
The expression \(2(x + 2)^2\) is minimized when \(x + 2 = 0\) (i.e., \(x = -2\)), and \(3(y - 4)^2\) is minimized when \(y - 4 = 0\) (i.e., \(y = 4\)). At these points, both squared terms equal zero.

Thus, the minimum value of the entire expression is:

\[
0 + 0 + 6 = 6
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\). I hope it is correct.
