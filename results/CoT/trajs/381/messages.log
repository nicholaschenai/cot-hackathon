The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is $13.$ The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed is $27.$ What is the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let the two-digit number be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit.

## Step 1: Set up the equations
From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The sum of the digits: 
   \[
   a + b = 13
   \]
2. The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed:
   \[
   (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27
   \]

## Step 2: Simplify the second equation
Simplifying the second equation:
\[
10a + b - 10b - a = 27
\]
\[
9a - 9b = 27
\]
Dividing through by 9:
\[
a - b = 3
\]

## Step 3: Solve the system of equations
Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( a + b = 13 \)
2. \( a - b = 3 \)

Adding these two equations:
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 13 + 3
\]
\[
2a = 16 \implies a = 8
\]

Substituting \( a = 8 \) back into the first equation:
\[
8 + b = 13 \implies b = 5
\]

Thus, the original number is:
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 8 + 5 = 85
\]

## Step 4: Find the number with digits reversed
The number with its digits reversed is:
\[
10b + a = 10 \times 5 + 8 = 58
\]

## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the original number and the reversed number
Now, we find the sum:
\[
85 + 58 = 143
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{143}\). I hope it is correct.
