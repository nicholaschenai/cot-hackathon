Define the function $f(x)=\frac{a}{1-x}$. If $f(-1)=f^{-1}(4a+1)$, find the product of all possible values of $a$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start with the function defined as \( f(x) = \frac{a}{1-x} \).

## Step 1: Calculate \( f(-1) \)
We substitute \( x = -1 \) into the function:
\[
f(-1) = \frac{a}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{a}{1 + 1} = \frac{a}{2}
\]

## Step 2: Find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(y) \)
To find the inverse, we set \( y = f(x) \):
\[
y = \frac{a}{1-x}
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
y(1-x) = a \implies y - yx = a \implies yx = y - a \implies x = \frac{y - a}{y}
\]
Thus, the inverse function is:
\[
f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y - a}{y}
\]

## Step 3: Calculate \( f^{-1}(4a + 1) \)
Now we substitute \( y = 4a + 1 \) into the inverse function:
\[
f^{-1}(4a + 1) = \frac{(4a + 1) - a}{4a + 1} = \frac{3a + 1}{4a + 1}
\]

## Step 4: Set up the equation
We know from the problem statement that:
\[
f(-1) = f^{-1}(4a + 1)
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\frac{a}{2} = \frac{3a + 1}{4a + 1}
\]

## Step 5: Cross-multiply to solve for \( a \)
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
a(4a + 1) = 2(3a + 1)
\]
Expanding both sides:
\[
4a^2 + a = 6a + 2
\]
Rearranging the equation:
\[
4a^2 + a - 6a - 2 = 0 \implies 4a^2 - 5a - 2 = 0
\]

## Step 6: Use the quadratic formula
We apply the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
Here, \( a = 4, b = -5, c = -2 \):
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-2) = 25 + 32 = 57
\]
Thus,
\[
a = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{8}
\]

## Step 7: Find the product of all possible values of \( a \)
The roots of the quadratic \( 4a^2 - 5a - 2 = 0 \) can be expressed as:
\[
a_1 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{57}}{8}, \quad a_2 = \frac{5 - \sqrt{57}}{8}
\]
The product of the roots of a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( \frac{c}{a} \):
\[
\text{Product} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}\). I hope it is correct.
