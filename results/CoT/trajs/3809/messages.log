What number is $5\%$ of $10\%$ of 1200?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate 10% of 1200
To find 10% of 1200, we multiply:
\[
10\% \text{ of } 1200 = \frac{10}{100} \times 1200 = 120
\]

## Step 2: Calculate 5% of the result from Step 1
Now, we find 5% of 120:
\[
5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 6
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.
