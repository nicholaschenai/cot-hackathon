Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that the binomial coefficient $\binom{10^9}{k}$ is less than the binomial coefficient $\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}$.  Let $a$ be the first (from the left) digit of $k$ and let $b$ be the second (from the left) digit of $k$.  What is the value of $10a + b$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that 

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}.
\]

Using the identity for binomial coefficients, we can express \( \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} \) as follows:

\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \binom{10^9}{k - 1} + \binom{10^9}{k}.
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9}{k - 1} + \binom{10^9}{k}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9}{k - 1}.
\]

This inequality holds when \( k \) is greater than the median of the binomial distribution, which is approximately \( \frac{n}{2} \) for \( n = 10^9 \). Therefore, we can estimate:

\[
k > \frac{10^9}{2} = 5 \times 10^8.
\]

To find the smallest integer \( k \) satisfying this condition, we can start checking values just above \( 5 \times 10^8 \).

1. For \( k = 5 \times 10^8 + 1 \):

   We need to check if 

   \[
   \binom{10^9}{5 \times 10^8 + 1} < \binom{10^9}{5 \times 10^8}.
   \]

   This is true because \( \binom{n}{r} \) is decreasing for \( r > \frac{n}{2} \).

2. For \( k = 5 \times 10^8 + 2 \):

   We check if 

   \[
   \binom{10^9}{5 \times 10^8 + 2} < \binom{10^9}{5 \times 10^8 + 1}.
   \]

   This is also true for the same reason.

Continuing this process, we find that the inequality holds for all \( k \) starting from \( 5 \times 10^8 + 1 \).

Thus, the smallest \( k \) that satisfies the original inequality is:

\[
k = 5 \times 10^8 + 1.
\]

Next, we need to find the first two digits of \( k \):

- The first digit \( a \) is \( 5 \).
- The second digit \( b \) is \( 0 \).

Finally, we compute \( 10a + b \):

\[
10a + b = 10 \times 5 + 0 = 50.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: 

\[
\boxed{50}.
\]
