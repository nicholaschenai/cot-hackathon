Let $S$ be the set of points $z$ in the complex plane such that $|z - 7 + 10i| \le 5.$  Find the area of $S.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the geometric shape
The inequality \( |z - 7 + 10i| \le 5 \) describes a circle in the complex plane. The center of the circle is at the point \( 7 - 10i \) (or \( (7, -10) \) in Cartesian coordinates), and the radius is \( 5 \).

## Step 2: Calculate the area of the circle
The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. Here, \( r = 5 \).

Calculating the area:
\[
A = \pi (5^2) = \pi \cdot 25 = 25\pi
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{25\pi}\). I hope it is correct.
