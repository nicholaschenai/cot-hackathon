Compute $\gcd(6^210^2,15^4)$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To compute \(\gcd(6^{2} \cdot 10^{2}, 15^{4})\), we will first find the prime factorizations of the numbers involved.

## Step 1: Prime Factorization
- \(6 = 2 \cdot 3\), so:
  \[
  6^{2} = (2 \cdot 3)^{2} = 2^{2} \cdot 3^{2}
  \]
  
- \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\), so:
  \[
  10^{2} = (2 \cdot 5)^{2} = 2^{2} \cdot 5^{2}
  \]

Combining these, we have:
\[
6^{2} \cdot 10^{2} = (2^{2} \cdot 3^{2}) \cdot (2^{2} \cdot 5^{2}) = 2^{4} \cdot 3^{2} \cdot 5^{2}
\]

- \(15 = 3 \cdot 5\), so:
  \[
  15^{4} = (3 \cdot 5)^{4} = 3^{4} \cdot 5^{4}
  \]

## Step 2: Finding the GCD
Now we find the \(\gcd\) by taking the minimum power of each prime factor present in both factorizations.

- For \(2\): 
  - In \(6^{2} \cdot 10^{2}\), the power is \(4\).
  - In \(15^{4}\), the power is \(0\) (since \(15\) has no factor of \(2\)).
  - Minimum: \(\min(4, 0) = 0\).

- For \(3\):
  - In \(6^{2} \cdot 10^{2}\), the power is \(2\).
  - In \(15^{4}\), the power is \(4\).
  - Minimum: \(\min(2, 4) = 2\).

- For \(5\):
  - In \(6^{2} \cdot 10^{2}\), the power is \(2\).
  - In \(15^{4}\), the power is \(4\).
  - Minimum: \(\min(2, 4) = 2\).

Thus, we have:
\[
\gcd(6^{2} \cdot 10^{2}, 15^{4}) = 2^{0} \cdot 3^{2} \cdot 5^{2} = 1 \cdot 9 \cdot 25 = 225
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{225}\). I hope it is correct.
