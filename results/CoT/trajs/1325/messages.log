How many positive integers are less than $100\pi$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find how many positive integers are less than \(100\pi\), we first need to calculate \(100\pi\).

## Step 1: Calculate \(100\pi\)
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[
100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314
\]

## Step 2: Determine the largest integer less than \(100\pi\)
The largest integer less than \(314\) is \(313\).

## Step 3: Count the positive integers
The positive integers less than \(100\pi\) are \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, 313\). The count of these integers is:
\[
313 - 1 + 1 = 313
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{313}\). I hope it is correct.
