How many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the numbers with 2 in the units place
The numbers from 1 to 200 that have a 2 in the units place are: 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102, 112, 122, 132, 142, 152, 162, 172, 182, 192.

## Step 2: Check divisibility by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Since all our numbers end in 2, we only need to check the tens digit:

- 02 (2) is divisible by 4.
- 12 (12) is divisible by 4.
- 22 (22) is not divisible by 4.
- 32 (32) is divisible by 4.
- 42 (42) is not divisible by 4.
- 52 (52) is divisible by 4.
- 62 (62) is not divisible by 4.
- 72 (72) is divisible by 4.
- 82 (82) is not divisible by 4.
- 92 (92) is divisible by 4.
- 102 (102) is not divisible by 4.
- 112 (112) is divisible by 4.
- 122 (122) is not divisible by 4.
- 132 (132) is divisible by 4.
- 142 (142) is not divisible by 4.
- 152 (152) is divisible by 4.
- 162 (162) is not divisible by 4.
- 172 (172) is divisible by 4.
- 182 (182) is not divisible by 4.
- 192 (192) is divisible by 4.

The numbers that are divisible by 4 are: 2, 12, 32, 52, 72, 92, 112, 132, 152, 172, 192.

## Step 3: Count the valid numbers
Counting these, we find there are 11 numbers: 2, 12, 32, 52, 72, 92, 112, 132, 152, 172, 192.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.
