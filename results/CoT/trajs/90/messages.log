Two consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let the two consecutive positive even numbers be \( x \) and \( x + 2 \).

## Step 1: Set up the equation
The difference of their squares can be expressed as:
\[
(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60
\]

## Step 2: Expand and simplify
Expanding the left side:
\[
(x^2 + 4x + 4) - x^2 = 60
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4x + 4 = 60
\]

## Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4x = 56
\]
Now, divide by 4:
\[
x = 14
\]

## Step 4: Find the two numbers and their sum
The two consecutive even numbers are \( 14 \) and \( 16 \). Their sum is:
\[
14 + 16 = 30
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{30}\). I hope it is correct.
