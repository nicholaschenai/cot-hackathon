When the positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are listed in ascending order, what is the fifth number listed?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the condition for having exactly three positive divisors
A positive integer has exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because if \( n = p^2 \) (where \( p \) is a prime), the divisors are \( 1, p, p^2 \).

## Step 2: List the squares of the first few prime numbers
The first few prime numbers are:
- \( 2 \)
- \( 3 \)
- \( 5 \)
- \( 7 \)
- \( 11 \)

Calculating their squares:
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 7^2 = 49 \)
- \( 11^2 = 121 \)

## Step 3: List the squares in ascending order
The numbers with exactly three positive divisors are:
- \( 4 \)
- \( 9 \)
- \( 25 \)
- \( 49 \)
- \( 121 \)

## Step 4: Identify the fifth number
The fifth number in this list is \( 121 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{121}$. I hope it is correct.
