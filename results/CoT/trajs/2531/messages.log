Let $m$ be a constant not equal to $0$ or $1.$ Then the graph of \[x^2 + my^2 = 4\]is a conic section with two foci. Find all values of $m$ such that the foci both lie on the circle $x^2+y^2=16.$

Enter all possible values of $m,$ separated by commas.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the values of \( m \) such that the foci of the conic section given by the equation \( x^2 + my^2 = 4 \) lie on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), we first recognize that the equation represents an ellipse when \( m > 0 \) and a hyperbola when \( m < 0 \).

## Step 1: Identify the conic section
The equation can be rewritten in standard form:
\[
\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{\frac{4}{m}} = 1
\]
This indicates that the conic is an ellipse if \( m > 0 \) and a hyperbola if \( m < 0 \).

## Step 2: Find the foci
For an ellipse, the foci are located at:
\[
(c, 0) \text{ and } (-c, 0) \quad \text{where } c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}
\]
Here, \( a^2 = 4 \) and \( b^2 = \frac{4}{m} \). Thus,
\[
c = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4}{m}} = \sqrt{4\left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)} = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}
\]
The foci are at \( (2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}, 0) \) and \( (-2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}, 0) \).

## Step 3: Condition for foci on the circle
The foci must lie on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \). Therefore, we set up the equation for the distance of the foci from the origin:
\[
(2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}})^2 + 0^2 = 16
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4(1 - \frac{1}{m}) = 16
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{m} = 4
\]
Rearranging this, we find:
\[
-\frac{1}{m} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = -\frac{1}{3}
\]

## Step 4: Check for other values of \( m \)
Since we are looking for values of \( m \) such that the foci lie on the circle, we also consider the case when \( m < 0 \) (hyperbola). The foci for a hyperbola are given by:
\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{4}{|m|}} = 2\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{|m|}}
\]
Setting this equal to 4 (the radius of the circle):
\[
2\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{|m|}} = 4
\]
Dividing by 2:
\[
\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{|m|}} = 2
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
1 + \frac{1}{|m|} = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{|m|} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |m| = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Since \( m < 0 \), we have \( m = -\frac{1}{3} \).

## Conclusion
The only value of \( m \) such that the foci of the conic section lie on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \) is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}. I hope it is correct.
