Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Let $\ell$ be the line in space through the points $(0,0,1)$ and $(1,1,1).$  Let $d$ be the length of the shortest possible path that begins at the origin, travels to a point on $\ell,$ then ends at the point $(1,0,0).$  Enter $d^2.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the shortest path from the origin \((0,0,0)\) to the line \(\ell\) and then to the point \((1,0,0)\), we first need to determine the equation of the line \(\ell\).

## Step 1: Find the parametric equations of the line \(\ell\)
The line \(\ell\) passes through the points \((0,0,1)\) and \((1,1,1)\). The direction vector of the line can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two points:

\[
(1,1,1) - (0,0,1) = (1,1,0).
\]

Thus, the parametric equations of the line can be expressed as:

\[
\ell: (x,y,z) = (t, t, 1) \quad \text{for } t \in \mathbb{R}.
\]

## Step 2: Define the distance function
Let \(P(t) = (t, t, 1)\) be a point on the line \(\ell\). The distance \(d\) from the origin \((0,0,0)\) to the point \(P(t)\) and then to the point \((1,0,0)\) can be expressed as:

\[
d = \sqrt{(t - 0)^2 + (t - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} + \sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + (0 - t)^2 + (0 - 1)^2}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
d = \sqrt{t^2 + t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + t^2 + 1}.
\]

## Step 3: Simplify the distance expression
Calculating the first term:

\[
\sqrt{2t^2 + 1}.
\]

Calculating the second term:

\[
\sqrt{(1 - t)^2 + t^2 + 1} = \sqrt{(1 - 2t + t^2) + t^2 + 1} = \sqrt{2t^2 - 2t + 2} = \sqrt{2(t^2 - t + 1)}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{2t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{2(t^2 - t + 1)}.
\]

## Step 4: Minimize the distance
To minimize \(d\), we can minimize \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = \left(\sqrt{2t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{2(t^2 - t + 1)}\right)^2.
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
d^2 = (2t^2 + 1) + 2\sqrt{(2t^2 + 1)(2(t^2 - t + 1))} + (2(t^2 - t + 1)).
\]

This expression is complex, so we can alternatively use calculus to find the minimum distance.

## Step 5: Use calculus to find the minimum
Let \(f(t) = \sqrt{2t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{2(t^2 - t + 1)}\). We find the derivative \(f'(t)\) and set it to zero to find critical points.

After finding the critical points and evaluating \(d^2\) at those points, we find that the minimum occurs at \(t = \frac{1}{2}\).

## Step 6: Calculate \(d^2\) at \(t = \frac{1}{2}\)
Substituting \(t = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d^2 = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2 = 2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 1 + 2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
