What is the sum of all of the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the range of multiples of 3
The smallest multiple of 3 greater than 100 is 102, and the largest multiple of 3 less than 200 is 198.

## Step 2: Determine the number of terms
The multiples of 3 between 102 and 198 can be expressed as:
\[ 102, 105, 108, \ldots, 198 \]
This is an arithmetic sequence where:
- First term \( a = 102 \)
- Common difference \( d = 3 \)

To find the number of terms \( n \), we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]
Setting \( a_n = 198 \):
\[ 198 = 102 + (n-1) \cdot 3 \]
\[ 198 - 102 = (n-1) \cdot 3 \]
\[ 96 = (n-1) \cdot 3 \]
\[ n-1 = 32 \]
\[ n = 33 \]

## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series
The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a + a_n) \]
Substituting the values:
\[ S_{33} = \frac{33}{2} \cdot (102 + 198) \]
\[ S_{33} = \frac{33}{2} \cdot 300 \]
\[ S_{33} = 33 \cdot 150 \]
\[ S_{33} = 4950 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{4950}$. I hope it is correct.
