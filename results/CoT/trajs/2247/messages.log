  ...

Regardless of the approach, always conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

If $|z| = 1$, express $\overline{z}$ as a simplified fraction in terms of $z$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Use the property of complex conjugates
For any complex number \( z \) expressed in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \) (since \( |z| = 1 \)), the complex conjugate is given by:
\[
\overline{z} = e^{-i\theta}
\]

## Step 2: Relate \( \overline{z} \) to \( z \)
Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we can express \( e^{-i\theta} \) in terms of \( z \):
\[
\overline{z} = \frac{1}{z}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{1}{z}}\). I hope it is correct.
