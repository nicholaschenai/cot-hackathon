Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word CEASE.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Count the total letters
The word "CEASE" consists of 5 letters.

## Step 2: Identify repeated letters
The letter 'E' appears twice.

## Step 3: Calculate arrangements
The formula for arrangements of letters with repetitions is given by:

\[
\text{Arrangements} = \frac{n!}{p_1! \times p_2! \times \ldots}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( p_1, p_2, \ldots \) are the frequencies of the repeated letters.

Here, \( n = 5 \) and the frequency of 'E' is 2. Thus, we have:

\[
\text{Arrangements} = \frac{5!}{2!} = \frac{120}{2} = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.
