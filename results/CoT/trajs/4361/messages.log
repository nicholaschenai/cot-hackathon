Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Tamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes needed
To find out how many boxes Tamantha needs, divide the total number of discs by the capacity of each box.

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{77}{12} \approx 6.4167
\]

## Step 2: Round up to the nearest whole number
Since Tamantha cannot buy a fraction of a box, round up to the next whole number.

\[
\text{Boxes needed} = 7
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.
