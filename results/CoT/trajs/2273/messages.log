================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by defining the points involved:

- Let \( P = (x, y) \).
- The point \( F = (4, 0) \).
- The projection \( Q \) of point \( P \) onto the line \( x = \frac{25}{4} \) is given by \( Q = \left(\frac{25}{4}, y\right) \).

Next, we need to express the distances \( PF \) and \( PQ \):

## Step 1: Calculate distances
The distance \( PF \) from \( P \) to \( F \) is calculated as:
\[
PF = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance \( PQ \) from \( P \) to \( Q \) is:
\[
PQ = \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2 + (y - y)^2} = \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
\]

## Step 2: Set up the ratio
According to the problem, we have the ratio:
\[
\frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( PF \) and \( PQ \):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2}}{\left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

## Step 3: Cross-multiply and simplify
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
5\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2} = 4\left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
\]
Squaring both sides results in:
\[
25((x - 4)^2 + y^2) = 16\left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2
\]

Expanding both sides:
- Left side:
\[
25((x - 4)^2 + y^2) = 25(x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2) = 25x^2 - 200x + 400 + 25y^2
\]

- Right side:
\[
16\left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2 = 16\left(x^2 - \frac{50}{4}x + \frac{625}{16}\right) = 16x^2 - 200x + 625
\]

Setting both sides equal:
\[
25x^2 - 200x + 400 + 25y^2 = 16x^2 - 200x + 625
\]

## Step 4: Rearranging the equation
Rearranging gives:
\[
(25x^2 - 16x^2) + 25y^2 + 400 - 625 = 0
\]
\[
9x^2 + 25y^2 - 225 = 0
\]
Dividing through by 225:
\[
\frac{9x^2}{225} + \frac{25y^2}{225} = 1
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1
\]

## Step 5: Identify the shape and calculate the area
This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis \( a = 5 \) and semi-minor axis \( b = 3 \).

The area \( A \) of an ellipse is given by:
\[
A = \pi \cdot a \cdot b = \pi \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 15\pi
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{15\pi}
\]
