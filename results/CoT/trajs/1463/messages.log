Bag A contains $3$ white and $2$ red balls. Bag B contains $6$ white and $3$ red balls. One of the two bags will be chosen at random, and then two balls will be drawn from that bag at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color?

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color, we will analyze the situation step by step.

## Step 1: Calculate the probability of choosing each bag
Since one of the two bags is chosen at random, the probability of choosing Bag A is \( \frac{1}{2} \) and the probability of choosing Bag B is also \( \frac{1}{2} \).

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag A
Bag A contains 3 white and 2 red balls. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from Bag A is:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = 10
\]

The number of ways to choose 2 white balls from Bag A is:

\[
\binom{3}{2} = 3
\]

The number of ways to choose 2 red balls from Bag A is:

\[
\binom{2}{2} = 1
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls of the same color from Bag A is:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Therefore, the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag A is:

\[
P(\text{same color} | A) = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag B
Bag B contains 6 white and 3 red balls. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from Bag B is:

\[
\binom{9}{2} = 36
\]

The number of ways to choose 2 white balls from Bag B is:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15
\]

The number of ways to choose 2 red balls from Bag B is:

\[
\binom{3}{2} = 3
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to choose 2 balls of the same color from Bag B is:

\[
15 + 3 = 18
\]

Therefore, the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag B is:

\[
P(\text{same color} | B) = \frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

## Step 4: Use the law of total probability
Now we can find the overall probability of drawing two balls of the same color:

\[
P(\text{same color}) = P(A) \cdot P(\text{same color} | A) + P(B) \cdot P(\text{same color} | B)
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
P(\text{same color}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 20:

\[
= \frac{4}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{9}{20}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: 

\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}. I hope it is correct.
