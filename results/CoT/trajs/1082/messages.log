Given $2^a = 32$ and $a^b = 125$ find $b^a$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Solve for \( a \)
We start with the equation \( 2^a = 32 \). We can express 32 as a power of 2:
\[
32 = 2^5
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
2^a = 2^5
\]
This implies:
\[
a = 5
\]

## Step 2: Solve for \( b \)
Next, we use the equation \( a^b = 125 \). Substituting \( a = 5 \) into the equation gives:
\[
5^b = 125
\]
We can express 125 as a power of 5:
\[
125 = 5^3
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
5^b = 5^3
\]
This implies:
\[
b = 3
\]

## Step 3: Calculate \( b^a \)
Now we need to find \( b^a \):
\[
b^a = 3^5
\]
Calculating \( 3^5 \):
\[
3^5 = 243
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{243}\). I hope it is correct.
