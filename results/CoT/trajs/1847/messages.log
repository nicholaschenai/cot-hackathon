[/asy] The area of the shaded region can be expressed in the form $a-b\pi$ square units, where $a$ and $b$ are both integers. What is the value of $a+b?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the area of the shaded region, we will first calculate the area of the square and then subtract the area of the quarter-circles.

## Step 1: Calculate the area of the square
The area \( A_{\text{square}} \) of a square with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
A_{\text{square}} = s^2
\]
For our square with side length 6 units:
\[
A_{\text{square}} = 6^2 = 36 \text{ square units}
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the area of one quarter-circle
The area \( A_{\text{quarter-circle}} \) of a quarter-circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
\[
A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
\]
For our quarter-circle with radius 3 units:
\[
A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi (3^2) = \frac{1}{4} \pi \cdot 9 = \frac{9\pi}{4} \text{ square units}
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the total area of the quarter-circles
Since there are 4 quarter-circles (one at each vertex of the square), the total area \( A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} \) is:
\[
A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} = 4 \times A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = 4 \times \frac{9\pi}{4} = 9\pi \text{ square units}
\]

## Step 4: Calculate the area of the shaded region
The area of the shaded region \( A_{\text{shaded}} \) is the area of the square minus the total area of the quarter-circles:
\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} = 36 - 9\pi
\]

This can be expressed in the form \( a - b\pi \) where \( a = 36 \) and \( b = 9 \).

Finally, we need to find \( a + b \):
\[
a + b = 36 + 9 = 45
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{45}\). I hope it is correct.
