There are finitely many primes $p$ for which the congruence $$8x\equiv 1\pmod{p}$$has no solutions $x$. Determine the sum of all such $p$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the primes \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has no solutions, we first need to analyze when this congruence has a solution.

The congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution if and only if \( 8 \) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \( p \). This is true if and only if \( 8 \) and \( p \) are coprime, which means \( \gcd(8, p) = 1 \).

The prime factorization of \( 8 \) is \( 2^3 \). Therefore, the only prime that can share a common factor with \( 8 \) is \( 2 \). 

Now, we check the case for \( p = 2 \):
- If \( p = 2 \), then \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \) simplifies to \( 0 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), which is false. Thus, there are no solutions for \( p = 2 \).

For any odd prime \( p \) (i.e., \( p \neq 2 \)), we have \( \gcd(8, p) = 1 \), and hence \( 8 \) has an inverse modulo \( p \). Therefore, the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has solutions for all odd primes.

In conclusion, the only prime \( p \) for which the congruence \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) has no solutions is \( p = 2 \).

Thus, the sum of all such \( p \) is:

\[
\text{Sum} = 2
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{2}\). I hope it is correct.
