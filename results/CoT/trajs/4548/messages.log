Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Compute
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ -7 & 4 & 2 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To compute the matrix multiplication 

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ -7 & 4 & 2 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we will perform the multiplication step by step.

## Step 1: Compute the first row
Multiply the first row of the matrix by the column vector:

\[
3 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot (-2) = 12 - 1 + 0 = 11.
\]

## Step 2: Compute the second row
Multiply the second row of the matrix by the column vector:

\[
-7 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot (-1) + 2 \cdot (-2) = -28 - 4 - 4 = -36.
\]

## Step 3: Compute the third row
Multiply the third row of the matrix by the column vector:

\[
0 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-2) = 0 - 5 + 2 = -3.
\]

Combining all the results, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 11 \\ -36 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 11 \\ -36 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}}\). I hope it is correct.
