Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

For real numbers $t$ where $\tan t$ and $\sec t$ are defined, the point
\[(x,y) = (\tan t, \sec t)\]is plotted.  All the plotted points lie on what kind of curve?

(A) Line
(B) Circle
(C) Parabola
(D) Ellipse
(E) Hyperbola

Enter the letter of the correct option.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) given \( x = \tan t \) and \( y = \sec t \), we can use the identity involving tangent and secant.

## Step 1: Use the Pythagorean identity
Recall the identity:
\[
\sec^2 t = 1 + \tan^2 t
\]
Substituting \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
y^2 = 1 + x^2
\]

## Step 2: Rearrange the equation
Rearranging gives:
\[
y^2 - x^2 = 1
\]

This is the standard form of a hyperbola.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{E}$. I hope it is correct.
