Find all the integer roots of
\[2x^3 + 13x^2 - 23x + 8 = 0.\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the integer roots of the polynomial \(2x^3 + 13x^2 - 23x + 8 = 0\), we can use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem suggests that any potential rational root, in this case integer roots, must be a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.

## Step 1: Identify potential integer roots
The constant term is \(8\) and the leading coefficient is \(2\). The factors of \(8\) are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\) and the factors of \(2\) are \(\pm 1, \pm 2\). Therefore, the possible integer roots are:
\[
\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8
\]

## Step 2: Test the potential roots
We will substitute each potential root into the polynomial to see if it equals zero.

1. For \(x = 1\):
   \[
   2(1)^3 + 13(1)^2 - 23(1) + 8 = 2 + 13 - 23 + 8 = 0
   \]
   So, \(x = 1\) is a root.

2. For \(x = -1\):
   \[
   2(-1)^3 + 13(-1)^2 - 23(-1) + 8 = -2 + 13 + 23 + 8 = 42 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

3. For \(x = 2\):
   \[
   2(2)^3 + 13(2)^2 - 23(2) + 8 = 16 + 52 - 46 + 8 = 30 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

4. For \(x = -2\):
   \[
   2(-2)^3 + 13(-2)^2 - 23(-2) + 8 = -16 + 52 + 46 + 8 = 90 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

5. For \(x = 4\):
   \[
   2(4)^3 + 13(4)^2 - 23(4) + 8 = 128 + 208 - 92 + 8 = 252 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

6. For \(x = -4\):
   \[
   2(-4)^3 + 13(-4)^2 - 23(-4) + 8 = -128 + 208 + 92 + 8 = 180 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

7. For \(x = 8\):
   \[
   2(8)^3 + 13(8)^2 - 23(8) + 8 = 1024 + 832 - 184 + 8 = 1680 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

8. For \(x = -8\):
   \[
   2(-8)^3 + 13(-8)^2 - 23(-8) + 8 = -1024 + 832 + 184 + 8 = -0 \quad (\text{not a root})
   \]

## Step 3: Factor the polynomial
Since we found \(x = 1\) as a root, we can perform synthetic division of \(2x^3 + 13x^2 - 23x + 8\) by \(x - 1\).

Performing synthetic division:
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
1 & 2 & 13 & -23 & 8 \\
  &   & 2  & 15  & -8 \\
\hline
  & 2 & 15 & -8 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]
This gives us \(2x^2 + 15x - 8\).

## Step 4: Find the roots of the quadratic
Now we can solve \(2x^2 + 15x - 8 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-8)}}{2 \cdot 2}
\]
Calculating the discriminant:
\[
15^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-8) = 225 + 64 = 289
\]
Thus,
\[
x = \frac{-15 \pm 17}{4}
\]
Calculating the two possible values:
1. \(x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\) (not an integer)
2. \(x = \frac{-32}{4} = -8\) (integer)

## Conclusion
The integer roots of the polynomial \(2x^3 + 13x^2 - 23x + 8 = 0\) are:
\[
1, -8
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1, -8}\). I hope it is correct.
