Let  \[f(x) =
\begin{cases}
k(x) &\text{if }x>0, \\
-\frac1{2x}&\text{if }x< 0\\
0&\text{if }x=0.
\end{cases}
\]Find the function $k(x)$ such that $f(x)$ is its own inverse function.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the function \( k(x) \) such that \( f(x) \) is its own inverse, we need to satisfy the condition \( f(f(x)) = x \) for all \( x \).

## Step 1: Evaluate \( f(f(x)) \) for \( x > 0 \)
For \( x > 0 \), we have \( f(x) = k(x) \). We need to find \( f(k(x)) \).

Since \( k(x) \) is assumed to be positive for \( x > 0 \), we have:
\[
f(k(x)) = k(k(x)).
\]

## Step 2: Evaluate \( f(f(x)) \) for \( x < 0 \)
For \( x < 0 \), we have \( f(x) = -\frac{1}{2x} \). We need to find \( f\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) \).

Since \( -\frac{1}{2x} \) is positive for \( x < 0 \), we have:
\[
f\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = k\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right).
\]

## Step 3: Evaluate \( f(f(x)) \) for \( x = 0 \)
For \( x = 0 \), we have:
\[
f(0) = 0.
\]
Thus, \( f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0 \).

## Step 4: Set up the equations
We need to satisfy:
1. \( k(k(x)) = x \) for \( x > 0 \)
2. \( k\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = x \) for \( x < 0 \)

## Step 5: Solve for \( k(x) \)
Assuming \( k(x) \) is a linear function, let \( k(x) = ax + b \).

### For \( x > 0 \):
From \( k(k(x)) = x \):
\[
k(k(x)) = k(ax + b) = a(ax + b) + b = a^2x + ab + b.
\]
Setting this equal to \( x \):
\[
a^2 = 1, \quad ab + b = 0.
\]
Thus, \( a = 1 \) or \( a = -1 \).

### For \( a = 1 \):
If \( a = 1 \), then \( k(x) = x + b \) and \( b = 0 \) gives \( k(x) = x \).

### For \( a = -1 \):
If \( a = -1 \), then \( k(x) = -x + b \) and \( b = 0 \) gives \( k(x) = -x \).

### Check \( k(x) = -x \):
For \( x < 0 \):
\[
k\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = -\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = \frac{1}{2x} \neq x.
\]
This does not satisfy the condition.

### Check \( k(x) = x \):
For \( x < 0 \):
\[
k\left(-\frac{1}{2x}\right) = -\frac{1}{2x} \neq x.
\]
This does not satisfy the condition either.

## Conclusion
The only function that satisfies \( f(f(x)) = x \) for all cases is:
\[
k(x) = -\frac{1}{2x}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \( \boxed{-\frac{1}{2x}} \). I hope it is correct.
