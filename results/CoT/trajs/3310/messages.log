Arnold must water his cactus plants every 9 days and he must feed them every 60 days. He watered and fed them last Tuesday. What day of the week will it be the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM)
To determine when Arnold will water and feed his cactus plants on the same day, we need to find the LCM of 9 days and 60 days.

The prime factorization of 9 is \(3^2\) and for 60 it is \(2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime:
- For 2: \(2^2\)
- For 3: \(3^2\)
- For 5: \(5^1\)

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
LCM = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 9 \times 5 = 180
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the day of the week
Arnold last watered and fed his plants on Tuesday. We need to find the day of the week 180 days later.

To find the day of the week, we calculate \(180 \mod 7\):
\[
180 \div 7 = 25 \quad \text{(remainder 5)}
\]
So, \(180 \mod 7 = 5\).

## Step 3: Determine the day of the week
Starting from Tuesday and moving forward 5 days:
- Wednesday (1)
- Thursday (2)
- Friday (3)
- Saturday (4)
- Sunday (5)

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$. I hope it is correct.
