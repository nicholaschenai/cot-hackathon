Find the constant $c$ such that $$(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0$$ for all $x.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the constant \( c \) such that 

\[
(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c) = 0
\]

for all \( x \), we will expand both sides and then equate coefficients.

## Step 1: Expand the first expression
We start with the first term:

\[
(x^2 - 4x + 3)(x + 5)
\]

Using the distributive property:

\[
= x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x^2 - 20x + 3x + 15
\]
\[
= x^3 + (5 - 4)x^2 + (-20 + 3)x + 15
\]
\[
= x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15
\]

## Step 2: Expand the second expression
Now we expand the second term:

\[
(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - c)
\]

Using the distributive property:

\[
= x^3 - cx^2 + 4x^2 - 4cx - 5x + 5c
\]
\[
= x^3 + (4 - c)x^2 + (-4c - 5)x + 5c
\]

## Step 3: Set up the equation
Now we set up the equation:

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 - (x^3 + (4 - c)x^2 + (-4c - 5)x + 5c) = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 - x^3 - (4 - c)x^2 - (-4c - 5)x - 5c = 0
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
(1 - (4 - c))x^2 + (-17 + 4c + 5)x + (15 - 5c) = 0
\]

This gives us:

\[
(c - 3)x^2 + (4c - 12)x + (15 - 5c) = 0
\]

## Step 4: Set coefficients to zero
Since this equation must hold for all \( x \), we set each coefficient to zero:

1. \( c - 3 = 0 \)
2. \( 4c - 12 = 0 \)
3. \( 15 - 5c = 0 \)

From the first equation:

\[
c = 3
\]

From the second equation:

\[
4c - 12 = 0 \implies 4c = 12 \implies c = 3
\]

From the third equation:

\[
15 - 5c = 0 \implies 5c = 15 \implies c = 3
\]

All equations confirm that \( c = 3 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
