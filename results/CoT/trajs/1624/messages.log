A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the number of distinct arrangements of 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees, we can use the formula for permutations of multiset:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items, \( n_1 \) is the number of identical items of the first type, and \( n_2 \) is the number of identical items of the second type.

## Step 1: Identify the total number of trees
The total number of trees is:
\[
n = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

## Step 2: Apply the formula
We have:
- \( n_1 = 2 \) (Golden Delicious apple trees)
- \( n_2 = 5 \) (Bartlett pear trees)

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 5!}
\]

Calculating the factorials:
\[
7! = 5040, \quad 2! = 2, \quad 5! = 120
\]

Now substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{5040}{2 \cdot 120} = \frac{5040}{240} = 21
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.
