Let $S$ be a set containing distinct integers such that the smallest element is 0 and the largest element is 2015.  Find the smallest possible average of the elements in $S.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the smallest possible average of the elements in the set \( S \), we start by noting that the average of a set of numbers is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of elements}}{\text{Number of elements}}
\]

## Step 1: Define the elements of the set
Let \( S = \{0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}, 2015\} \), where \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1} \) are distinct integers between 0 and 2015. The smallest element is 0 and the largest is 2015.

## Step 2: Minimize the sum of elements
To minimize the average, we need to minimize the sum of the elements in \( S \). The sum can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Sum} = 0 + a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{n-1} + 2015 = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{n-1} + 2015
\]

To minimize the sum, we should choose \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1} \) to be the smallest possible distinct integers. The smallest integers we can choose are \( 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \).

## Step 3: Calculate the sum and average
If we choose \( n-1 \) elements as \( 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \), the sum becomes:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n-1) + 2015 = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + 2015
\]

The number of elements in \( S \) is \( n \) (including 0 and 2015). Thus, the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\frac{(n-1)n}{2} + 2015}{n}
\]

## Step 4: Simplify the average expression
We can simplify the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2n} + \frac{2015}{n} = \frac{(n-1)}{2} + \frac{2015}{n}
\]

## Step 5: Minimize the average
To minimize this expression, we can analyze it as \( n \) increases. As \( n \) increases, the term \( \frac{2015}{n} \) decreases, but the term \( \frac{(n-1)}{2} \) increases. 

To find the minimum, we can test small values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 2 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2015}{2} = 1008
  \]

- For \( n = 3 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2015}{3} = 1 + 671.67 \approx 672.67
  \]

- For \( n = 4 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{2015}{4} = 1.5 + 503.75 = 505.25
  \]

- For \( n = 5 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{4}{2} + \frac{2015}{5} = 2 + 403 = 405
  \]

- For \( n = 6 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{2015}{6} = 2.5 + 335.83 \approx 338.33
  \]

- For \( n = 7 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{6}{2} + \frac{2015}{7} = 3 + 287.86 \approx 290.86
  \]

- For \( n = 8 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{2015}{8} = 3.5 + 251.875 \approx 255.375
  \]

- For \( n = 9 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{8}{2} + \frac{2015}{9} = 4 + 223.89 \approx 227.89
  \]

- For \( n = 10 \):
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{9}{2} + \frac{2015}{10} = 4.5 + 201.5 = 206
  \]

Continuing this process, we find that the average decreases until \( n = 2016 \) where the average becomes:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2015}{2016} \approx 1
\]

Thus, the smallest possible average occurs when \( S \) contains all integers from \( 0 \) to \( 2015 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1007.5}\). I hope it is correct.
