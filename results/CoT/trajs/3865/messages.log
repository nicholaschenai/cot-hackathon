Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What is $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}$ is equal to?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we can add the fractions directly.

## Step 1: Find a common denominator
The denominators are 2, 4, and 8. The least common denominator (LCD) is 8.

## Step 2: Convert each fraction
- \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{8}\)
- \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8}\)
- \(\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}\)

## Step 3: Add the fractions
Now we can add them:
\[
\frac{4}{8} + \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4 + 2 + 1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.
