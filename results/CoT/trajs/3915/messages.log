Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What is the value of $x$ in the equation $3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Simplify the equation
Start with the equation:
\[
3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23
\]
Distribute the \(3\) in \(3(1+x)\):
\[
3x + 2 + 3 + 3x = 23
\]

## Step 2: Combine like terms
Combine the \(3x\) terms and the constants:
\[
6x + 5 = 23
\]

## Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Subtract \(5\) from both sides:
\[
6x = 18
\]
Now, divide by \(6\):
\[
x = 3
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
