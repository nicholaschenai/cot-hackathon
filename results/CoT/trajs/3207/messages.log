What is the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify possible digit combinations
To find three-digit integers where the product of the digits equals 6, we need to consider the factors of 6. The possible combinations of three digits (a, b, c) that multiply to 6 are:
- (1, 1, 6)
- (1, 2, 3)

## Step 2: Form three-digit integers
From the combinations:
1. For (1, 1, 6), the possible three-digit integers are 116, 161, and 611.
2. For (1, 2, 3), the possible three-digit integers are 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321.

## Step 3: Determine the greatest integer
Now, we list all the integers obtained:
- From (1, 1, 6): 116, 161, 611
- From (1, 2, 3): 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321

The greatest integer from this list is 611.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{611}$. I hope it is correct.
