Without using a calculator, compute $1002^2-502^2+298^2-202^2$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the expression \(1002^2 - 502^2 + 298^2 - 202^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula, which states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\).

## Step 1: Compute \(1002^2 - 502^2\)
Let \(a = 1002\) and \(b = 502\).

Using the difference of squares:
\[
1002^2 - 502^2 = (1002 - 502)(1002 + 502)
\]
Calculating the terms:
\[
1002 - 502 = 500
\]
\[
1002 + 502 = 1504
\]
Thus,
\[
1002^2 - 502^2 = 500 \times 1504
\]

## Step 2: Compute \(298^2 - 202^2\)
Let \(c = 298\) and \(d = 202\).

Using the difference of squares:
\[
298^2 - 202^2 = (298 - 202)(298 + 202)
\]
Calculating the terms:
\[
298 - 202 = 96
\]
\[
298 + 202 = 500
\]
Thus,
\[
298^2 - 202^2 = 96 \times 500
\]

## Step 3: Combine the results
Now we combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2:
\[
1002^2 - 502^2 + 298^2 - 202^2 = (500 \times 1504) + (96 \times 500)
\]
Factoring out \(500\):
\[
= 500 \times (1504 + 96)
\]
Calculating the sum:
\[
1504 + 96 = 1600
\]
Thus,
\[
= 500 \times 1600
\]

## Step 4: Final calculation
Calculating \(500 \times 1600\):
\[
500 \times 1600 = 800000
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{800000}\). I hope it is correct.
