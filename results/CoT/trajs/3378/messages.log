Find the positive base $b$ in which the equation $4 \cdot 12 = 103$ is valid.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the positive base \( b \) in which the equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) is valid, we will convert each number from base \( b \) to base 10.

## Step 1: Convert \( 4 \) and \( 12 \) to base 10
In base \( b \):
- The number \( 4 \) is simply \( 4 \) in base 10.
- The number \( 12 \) in base \( b \) is calculated as:
  \[
  1 \cdot b^1 + 2 \cdot b^0 = b + 2
  \]

## Step 2: Calculate the left side of the equation
Now, we calculate the left side of the equation:
\[
4 \cdot 12 = 4 \cdot (b + 2) = 4b + 8
\]

## Step 3: Convert \( 103 \) to base 10
Next, we convert \( 103 \) in base \( b \) to base 10:
\[
1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b^1 + 3 \cdot b^0 = b^2 + 3
\]

## Step 4: Set up the equation
Now we set the left side equal to the right side:
\[
4b + 8 = b^2 + 3
\]

## Step 5: Rearrange the equation
Rearranging gives us:
\[
b^2 - 4b + 3 - 8 = 0 \implies b^2 - 4b - 5 = 0
\]

## Step 6: Factor the quadratic
Factoring the quadratic:
\[
(b - 5)(b + 1) = 0
\]

## Step 7: Solve for \( b \)
Setting each factor to zero gives:
\[
b - 5 = 0 \implies b = 5
\]
\[
b + 1 = 0 \implies b = -1 \quad (\text{not a positive base})
\]

Therefore, the only positive solution is \( b = 5 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\). I hope it is correct.
