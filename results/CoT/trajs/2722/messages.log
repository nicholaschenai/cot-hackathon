Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exists $r \in (0, \tfrac{1}{1000})$ such that the number $(n+r)^3$ is an integer.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exists \( r \in (0, \tfrac{1}{1000}) \) such that \( (n+r)^3 \) is an integer, we start by expressing \( (n+r)^3 \) in a more manageable form.

## Step 1: Expand the expression
We expand \( (n+r)^3 \):
\[
(n+r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3
\]
For \( (n+r)^3 \) to be an integer, the term \( 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3 \) must also be an integer. Since \( r \) is a small positive number, we can analyze the term \( 3n^2r \) first.

## Step 2: Analyze the term \( 3n^2r \)
For \( 3n^2r \) to be an integer, \( r \) must be of the form \( \frac{k}{3n^2} \) for some integer \( k \). We also need \( r \) to satisfy \( 0 < r < \frac{1}{1000} \).

This gives us:
\[
0 < \frac{k}{3n^2} < \frac{1}{1000}
\]
which implies:
\[
0 < k < \frac{3n^2}{1000}
\]

## Step 3: Find the smallest \( n \)
To find the smallest \( n \), we need \( k \) to be a positive integer. Thus, we require:
\[
3n^2 > 1000 \implies n^2 > \frac{1000}{3} \approx 333.33 \implies n > \sqrt{333.33} \approx 18.26
\]
The smallest integer \( n \) satisfying this inequality is \( n = 19 \).

## Step 4: Verify \( n = 19 \)
Now we check if \( n = 19 \) allows for a suitable \( r \):
\[
3n^2 = 3 \times 19^2 = 3 \times 361 = 1083
\]
We need \( k \) such that:
\[
0 < k < \frac{1083}{1000} \implies 0 < k < 1.083
\]
The only integer \( k \) that satisfies this is \( k = 1 \).

Setting \( k = 1 \):
\[
r = \frac{1}{3n^2} = \frac{1}{3 \times 361} = \frac{1}{1083}
\]
This \( r \) is indeed in the interval \( (0, \frac{1}{1000}) \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exists \( r \in (0, \tfrac{1}{1000}) \) making \( (n+r)^3 \) an integer is:

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{19}\). I hope it is correct.
