How many positive integer solutions exist for $3(x-5)\le 7$ ?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Solve the inequality
First, we simplify the inequality:
\[
3(x - 5) \leq 7
\]
Dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x - 5 \leq \frac{7}{3}
\]
Adding 5 to both sides:
\[
x \leq 5 + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{15}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{22}{3}
\]

## Step 2: Determine the range of \(x\)
Since \(x\) must be a positive integer, we find the largest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{22}{3}\):
\[
\frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33
\]
Thus, the possible positive integer values for \(x\) are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).

## Step 3: Count the solutions
The positive integers from 1 to 7 give us:
\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
\]
This results in a total of 7 solutions.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.
