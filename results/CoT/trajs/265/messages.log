Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

There are real numbers $A$ and $B$ such that
\[\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\frac{A}{x-2}+\frac{B}{x-5}.\]Find $A+B$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\frac{A}{x-2}+\frac{B}{x-5},
\]

we first factor the denominator on the left side:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 10 = (x-2)(x-5).
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{5x-16}{(x-2)(x-5)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-5}.
\]

Next, we combine the right-hand side over a common denominator:

\[
\frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-5} = \frac{A(x-5) + B(x-2)}{(x-2)(x-5)}.
\]

Setting the numerators equal gives us:

\[
5x - 16 = A(x - 5) + B(x - 2).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
A(x - 5) + B(x - 2) = Ax - 5A + Bx - 2B = (A + B)x - (5A + 2B).
\]

Now we equate coefficients from both sides:

1. For the coefficient of \(x\):
   \[
   A + B = 5.
   \]

2. For the constant term:
   \[
   -(5A + 2B) = -16 \implies 5A + 2B = 16.
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:

1. \(A + B = 5\)
2. \(5A + 2B = 16\)

We can solve this system. From the first equation, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(A\):

\[
B = 5 - A.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
5A + 2(5 - A) = 16,
\]
\[
5A + 10 - 2A = 16,
\]
\[
3A + 10 = 16,
\]
\[
3A = 6 \implies A = 2.
\]

Now substituting \(A = 2\) back into the equation for \(B\):

\[
B = 5 - 2 = 3.
\]

Finally, we find \(A + B\):

\[
A + B = 2 + 3 = 5.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\). I hope it is correct.
