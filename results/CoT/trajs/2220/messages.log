The sum of an infinite geometric series is a positive number $S$, and the second term in the series is $1$. What is the smallest possible value of $S?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Identify the first term and common ratio
Let the first term of the geometric series be \( a \) and the common ratio be \( r \). The second term is given by \( ar = 1 \).

## Step 2: Express the sum of the series
The sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula:
\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]
Since \( ar = 1 \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
a = \frac{1}{r}
\]

## Step 3: Substitute \( a \) into the sum formula
Substituting \( a \) into the sum formula gives:
\[
S = \frac{\frac{1}{r}}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{r(1 - r)}
\]

## Step 4: Find the minimum value of \( S \)
To minimize \( S \), we need to analyze the function \( S(r) = \frac{1}{r(1 - r)} \). The domain for \( r \) is \( 0 < r < 1 \).

Taking the derivative and setting it to zero to find critical points:
\[
S'(r) = \frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{1}{r(1 - r)} \right)
\]
Using the quotient rule:
\[
S'(r) = \frac{(1 - r)(0) - 1(-1)}{(r(1 - r))^2} = \frac{1}{(r(1 - r))^2}
\]
Setting \( S'(r) = 0 \) does not yield any critical points, so we check the endpoints.

## Step 5: Evaluate limits as \( r \) approaches 0 and 1
As \( r \to 0^+ \):
\[
S \to \infty
\]
As \( r \to 1^- \):
\[
S \to \infty
\]

## Step 6: Find the minimum value in the interval
To find the minimum value, we can use the AM-GM inequality:
\[
r(1 - r) \leq \left( \frac{r + (1 - r)}{2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Thus,
\[
S \geq \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4
\]

## Step 7: Check if \( S = 4 \) is achievable
Setting \( r = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
a = \frac{1}{r} = 2
\]
Then,
\[
S = \frac{2}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{2}} = 4
\]

Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is: 
\[
\boxed{4}
\] I hope it is correct.
