The average American consumes 1483 pounds of candy in a lifetime. Assuming that 1 year $=$ 52 weeks and the average life-span is 75 years, how many pounds of candy per week does the average American consume? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of weeks in a lifetime
The average lifespan is 75 years. Since there are 52 weeks in a year:

\[
\text{Total weeks} = 75 \text{ years} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 3900 \text{ weeks}
\]

## Step 2: Calculate the average candy consumption per week
The total candy consumption over a lifetime is 1483 pounds. To find the weekly consumption, divide the total by the number of weeks:

\[
\text{Candy per week} = \frac{1483 \text{ pounds}}{3900 \text{ weeks}} \approx 0.38 \text{ pounds/week}
\]

## Step 3: Round to the nearest hundredth
The value 0.38 is already rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{0.38}$. I hope it is correct.
