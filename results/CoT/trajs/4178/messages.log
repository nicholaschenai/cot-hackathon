To find the perimeter of triangle \( \triangle PQS \), we need to determine the lengths of sides \( PQ \), \( QS \), and \( PS \).

## Step 1: Calculate \( PQ \)
From the diagram, we see that \( PQ \) is the horizontal leg of the right triangle \( PQR \). The length of \( PQ \) is given as \( 13 \).

## Step 2: Calculate \( QS \)
The length \( QS \) is the vertical leg of the right triangle \( QRS \). The length of \( QS \) is given as \( 20 \) (since \( QS = QR + RS = 5 + 15 \)).

## Step 3: Calculate \( PS \)
To find \( PS \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( PQS \):
\[
PS^2 = PQ^2 + QS^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
PS^2 = 13^2 + 20^2 = 169 + 400 = 569
\]
Thus,
\[
PS = \sqrt{569}
\]

## Step 4: Calculate the perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of triangle \( PQS \) is given by:
\[
P = PQ + QS + PS = 13 + 20 + \sqrt{569}
\]
Calculating the numerical value:
\[
P = 33 + \sqrt{569}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{33 + \sqrt{569}}\). I hope it is correct.
