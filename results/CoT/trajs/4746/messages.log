Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

The parametric curve $(x,y) = (\sin t, \sin 2t)$ is plotted below.

[asy]
unitsize(2 cm);

pair moo (real t) {
  return (sin(t),sin(2*t));
}

real t;
path foo = moo(0);

for (t = 0; t <= 2*pi + 0.1; t = t + 0.1) {
  foo = foo--moo(t);
}

draw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0));
draw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2));
draw(foo,red);
[/asy]

This curve can also be expressed in the form
\[ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0,\]where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers.  Find the smallest possible value of $a + b + c.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To express the parametric equations \( x = \sin t \) and \( y = \sin 2t \) in the form \( ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0 \), we start by using the double angle identity for sine:

\[
y = \sin 2t = 2 \sin t \cos t = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Next, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
y^2 = (2x \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 4x^2(1 - x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^4
\]

Rearranging this equation gives:

\[
4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0
\]

Now, we can identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

- \( a = 4 \)
- \( b = 4 \)
- \( c = 1 \)

Next, we calculate \( a + b + c \):

\[
a + b + c = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9
\]

Thus, the smallest possible value of \( a + b + c \) is:

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{9}\). I hope it is correct.
