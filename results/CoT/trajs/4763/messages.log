A particle moves so that it is at $\left( 3 \sin \frac{t}{4}, 3 \cos \frac{t}{4} \right)$ at time $t.$  Find the speed of the particle, measured in unit of distance per unit of time.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the speed of the particle, we first need to determine its velocity by differentiating its position with respect to time \( t \).

## Step 1: Find the position function
The position of the particle is given by:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = \left( 3 \sin \frac{t}{4}, 3 \cos \frac{t}{4} \right)
\]

## Step 2: Differentiate to find velocity
We differentiate each component of the position function with respect to \( t \):
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 3 \sin \frac{t}{4} \right) = 3 \cdot \cos \frac{t}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \cos \frac{t}{4}
\]
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 3 \cos \frac{t}{4} \right) = 3 \cdot (-\sin \frac{t}{4}) \cdot \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{3}{4} \sin \frac{t}{4}
\]

Thus, the velocity vector is:
\[
\mathbf{v}(t) = \left( \frac{3}{4} \cos \frac{t}{4}, -\frac{3}{4} \sin \frac{t}{4} \right)
\]

## Step 3: Calculate the speed
The speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector:
\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{4} \cos \frac{t}{4} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{3}{4} \sin \frac{t}{4} \right)^2}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
= \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 \cos^2 \frac{t}{4} + \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 \sin^2 \frac{t}{4}}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 \left( \cos^2 \frac{t}{4} + \sin^2 \frac{t}{4} \right)}
\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \( \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1 \):
\[
= \sqrt{\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.
