Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the probability that the product of the integers picked by Krishanu and Shaunak is more than 10, we will first determine the total number of possible outcomes and then the number of favorable outcomes.

## Step 1: Calculate total outcomes
Each can pick an integer from 1 to 10, so the total number of outcomes is:
\[
10 \times 10 = 100
\]

## Step 2: Calculate favorable outcomes
We need to find the pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(x \cdot y > 10\). We will count the pairs where \(x \cdot y \leq 10\) and subtract from the total.

### Case 1: \(x = 1\)
- \(y\) can be \(1, 2, \ldots, 10\) (10 outcomes)

### Case 2: \(x = 2\)
- \(y\) can be \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\) (5 outcomes)

### Case 3: \(x = 3\)
- \(y\) can be \(1, 2, 3\) (3 outcomes)

### Case 4: \(x = 4\)
- \(y\) can be \(1, 2\) (2 outcomes)

### Case 5: \(x = 5\)
- \(y\) can be \(1\) (1 outcome)

### Case 6: \(x = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\)
- \(y\) cannot be any value since \(6 \cdot 2 = 12\) and higher values will exceed 10 (0 outcomes)

Now, we sum the outcomes where \(x \cdot y \leq 10\):
\[
10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21
\]

## Step 3: Calculate favorable outcomes
The number of outcomes where \(x \cdot y > 10\) is:
\[
100 - 21 = 79
\]

## Step 4: Calculate probability
The probability that the product is more than 10 is:
\[
\frac{79}{100}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{79}{100}}\). I hope it is correct.
