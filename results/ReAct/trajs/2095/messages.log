A decorative arrangement of floor tiles forms concentric circles, as shown in the figure to the right. The smallest circle has a radius of 2 feet, and each successive circle has a radius 2 feet longer. All the lines shown intersect at the center and form 12 congruent central angles. What is the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\pi$. [asy]

To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to determine the areas of the circles involved. The smallest circle has a radius of 2 feet, and each successive circle has a radius that increases by 2 feet. 

The radii of the circles are:
- First circle: \( r_1 = 2 \) feet
- Second circle: \( r_2 = 4 \) feet
- Third circle: \( r_3 = 6 \) feet
- Fourth circle: \( r_4 = 8 \) feet

Next, we will calculate the area of each circle using the formula for the area of a circle, which is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Let's calculate the area of each circle step by step. 

1. **Area of the first circle** (\( r_1 = 2 \)):
   \[
   A_1 = \pi (2^2) = \pi \cdot 4 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Area of the second circle** (\( r_2 = 4 \)):
   \[
   A_2 = \pi (4^2) = \pi \cdot 16 = 16\pi
   \]

3. **Area of the third circle** (\( r_3 = 6 \)):
   \[
   A_3 = \pi (6^2) = \pi \cdot 36 = 36\pi
   \]

4. **Area of the fourth circle** (\( r_4 = 8 \)):
   \[
   A_4 = \pi (8^2) = \pi \cdot 64 = 64\pi
   \]

Now, we have the areas of all four circles. The shaded region is the area between the second circle and the third circle. 

Next, we will calculate the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the second circle from the area of the third circle:

\[
\text{Area of shaded region} = A_3 - A_2
\]

Let's compute this area.

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

A2 = 16*pi
A3 = 36*pi
shaded_area = A3 - A2
shaded_area

Result: 20*pi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area of the shaded region is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Area of shaded region} = A_3 - A_2 = 36\pi - 16\pi = 20\pi
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{20\pi}\). I hope it is correct.
