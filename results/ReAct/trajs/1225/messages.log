Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the probability that the three couples sit together in a socially optimal configuration, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of seating arrangements**: Since there are 6 people, the total number of ways to arrange them in a row is given by \(6!\).

2. **Determine the number of favorable arrangements**: For the socially optimal configuration, we can treat each couple as a single unit or block. This means we have 3 blocks (couples) to arrange. Each couple can be arranged in 2 ways (the two individuals can switch places). 

3. **Calculate the total arrangements of the blocks and the arrangements within each block**: The total arrangements will be the arrangements of the blocks multiplied by the arrangements within each block.

Let's start with the first step and calculate the total number of seating arrangements. 

I'll calculate \(6!\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_0fUssaNskbnFbdQsuWEjEUOw)
 Call ID: call_0fUssaNskbnFbdQsuWEjEUOw
  Args:
    code: import sympy as sp; total_arrangements = sp.factorial(6); total_arrangements
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

total_arrangements = sp.factorial(6)
total_arrangements

Result: 720
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of seating arrangements for the 6 people is \(6! = 720\).

Next, let's move on to the second step and calculate the number of favorable arrangements where each couple sits together. 

1. We treat each couple as a block, so we have 3 blocks to arrange.
2. The number of ways to arrange these 3 blocks is \(3!\).
3. Each couple can be arranged in 2 ways (the two individuals can switch places), so for 3 couples, this gives us \(2^3\).

Now, let's calculate the number of favorable arrangements. I'll compute \(3! \times 2^3\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_kgdWmUIKBAsZa0FfikgOOgZT)
 Call ID: call_kgdWmUIKBAsZa0FfikgOOgZT
  Args:
    code: favorable_arrangements = sp.factorial(3) * (2**3); favorable_arrangements
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
favorable_arrangements = sp.factorial(3) * (2**3)
favorable_arrangements

Result: 48
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The number of favorable arrangements where each couple sits together is \(3! \times 2^3 = 48\).

Now, we can find the probability that the couples sit in a socially optimal configuration by dividing the number of favorable arrangements by the total number of arrangements.

The probability \(P\) can be calculated as:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{48}{720}
\]

Let's simplify this fraction. I'll compute \(\frac{48}{720}\).

It seems I attempted to simplify a float instead of a fraction. Let me compute the fraction \(\frac{48}{720}\) and simplify it correctly.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_zvj6K2W9GFEdGT4yB8UMCniy)
 Call ID: call_zvj6K2W9GFEdGT4yB8UMCniy
  Args:
    code: from sympy import Rational; probability = Rational(48, 720).simplify(); probability
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

probability = Rational(48, 720).simplify()
probability

Result: 1/15
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The probability that the couples sit in a socially optimal configuration is \(\frac{1}{15}\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}\). I hope it is correct.
