## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

How many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we need to find numbers between 1 and 200 that meet two criteria:

1. They have a 2 in the units place.
2. They are divisible by 4.

First, let's identify the numbers that have a 2 in the units place. These numbers are: 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102, 112, 122, 132, 142, 152, 162, 172, 182, 192.

Next, we need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

Let's list the numbers with a 2 in the units place and check their divisibility by 4. 

I'll start by listing the numbers and checking their divisibility by 4.

# List of numbers with 2 in the units place from 1 to 200
numbers_with_2 = [i for i in range(1, 201) if i % 10 == 2]

# Check which of these numbers are divisible by 4
divisible_by_4 = [num for num in numbers_with_2 if num % 4 == 0]

len(divisible_by_4)

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:


# List of numbers with 2 in the units place from 1 to 200
numbers_with_2 = [i for i in range(1, 201) if i % 10 == 2]

# Check which of these numbers are divisible by 4
divisible_by_4 = [num for num in numbers_with_2 if num % 4 == 0]

len(divisible_by_4)

Result: 10
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After listing the numbers that have a 2 in the units place, I found that there are 10 such numbers that are also divisible by 4.

Now, let's summarize the findings:

1. The numbers with a 2 in the units place from 1 to 200 are: 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102, 112, 122, 132, 142, 152, 162, 172, 182, 192.
2. Out of these, 10 numbers are divisible by 4.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.
