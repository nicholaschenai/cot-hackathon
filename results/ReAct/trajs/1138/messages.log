You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

The graph of $y=ax^2+bx+c$ passes through points $(0,5)$, $(1,10)$, and $(2,19)$. Find $a+b+c$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the quadratic equation \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), we can use the points given: \((0,5)\), \((1,10)\), and \((2,19)\).

1. **Using the point (0, 5)**:
   When \(x = 0\), \(y = 5\):
   \[
   c = 5
   \]

2. **Using the point (1, 10)**:
   When \(x = 1\), \(y = 10\):
   \[
   10 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c
   \]
   Substituting \(c = 5\):
   \[
   10 = a + b + 5
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   a + b = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

3. **Using the point (2, 19)**:
   When \(x = 2\), \(y = 19\):
   \[
   19 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c
   \]
   Substituting \(c = 5\):
   \[
   19 = 4a + 2b + 5
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   4a + 2b = 14
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2a + b = 7 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \(a + b = 5\)
2. \(2a + b = 7\)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. 

Let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \(b\). 

I will execute this step now.

a, b = symbols('a b')
equation1 = Eq(a + b, 5)
equation2 = Eq(2*a + b, 7)

Result: {a: 2, b: 3}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

From the calculations, we found that:
\[
a = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 3
\]

Now, we already determined that \(c = 5\). 

Next, we can find \(a + b + c\):
\[
a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 5
\]

I will calculate this sum now.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The sum \(a + b + c\) is:
\[
2 + 3 + 5 = 10
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{10}\). I hope it is correct.
