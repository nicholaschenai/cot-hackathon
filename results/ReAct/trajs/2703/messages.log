Find all real values of $x$ such that $$\frac{2x^2-3x}{x^2-x} + 5x -11 = \frac{3x^2+5x+2}{x^2-1}.$$Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{2x^2-3x}{x^2-x} + 5x - 11 = \frac{3x^2+5x+2}{x^2-1},
\]

we first need to simplify both sides. 

1. **Identify the denominators**: The left side has a denominator of \(x^2 - x\) and the right side has a denominator of \(x^2 - 1\). We can factor these denominators:
   - \(x^2 - x = x(x - 1)\)
   - \(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\)

2. **Find a common denominator**: The common denominator for both sides will be \(x(x - 1)(x + 1)\).

3. **Rewrite the equation**: We will multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions. 

Let's start by rewriting the equation with the common denominator. 

Now, I will execute the first step of rewriting the equation.

Result: Eq((3*x + 2)/(x - 1), (5*x**2 - 14*x + 8)/(x - 1))
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After simplifying, we have the equation:

\[
\frac{3x + 2}{x - 1} = \frac{5x^2 - 14x + 8}{x - 1}.
\]

Since both sides have the same denominator \(x - 1\), we can multiply both sides by \(x - 1\) (assuming \(x \neq 1\)) to eliminate the denominator:

\[
3x + 2 = 5x^2 - 14x + 8.
\]

Next, we will rearrange this equation to set it to zero. 

Let's move all terms to one side of the equation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After rearranging, we have:

\[
5x^2 - 17x - 6 = 0.
\]

Now, we will solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \(a = 5\), \(b = -17\), and \(c = -6\).

Let's calculate the discriminant and then find the values of \(x\).

Result: (409, 17/10 + sqrt(409)/10, 17/10 - sqrt(409)/10)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The discriminant \(D\) is \(409\), which is positive, indicating that there are two distinct real solutions. 

The solutions are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{409}}{10}, \quad x_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{409}}{10}.
\]

Next, we need to ensure that these solutions do not make the original denominators zero. The denominators are \(x^2 - x\) and \(x^2 - 1\). 

Let's check if \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are valid by ensuring they do not equal \(0\) or \(1\). 

I'll calculate \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) to check their values.

x1_value, x2_value

Result: (17/10 + sqrt(409)/10, 17/10 - sqrt(409)/10)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The values of the solutions are:

\[
x_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{409}}{10}, \quad x_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{409}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to check if these values are equal to \(0\) or \(1\):

1. **For \(x_1\)**:
   - \(x_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{409}}{10}\) is clearly greater than \(1\) since \(17 + \sqrt{409} > 10\).

2. **For \(x_2\)**:
   - \(x_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{409}}{10}\). We need to check if this is \(0\) or \(1\):
     - \(x_2 = 0\) would imply \(17 - \sqrt{409} = 0\), which is not true since \(\sqrt{409} \approx 20.223\).
     - \(x_2 = 1\) would imply \(17 - \sqrt{409} = 10\), which is also not true.

Thus, both solutions are valid and do not make the denominators zero.

Therefore, the final answer is: 

\[
\boxed{\frac{17 + \sqrt{409}}{10}, \frac{17 - \sqrt{409}}{10}}.
\] 

I hope it is correct.
