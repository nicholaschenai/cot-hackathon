You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

There are real numbers $A$ and $B$ such that
\[\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\frac{A}{x-2}+\frac{B}{x-5}.\]Find $A+B$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{5x-16}{x^2-7x+10}=\frac{A}{x-2}+\frac{B}{x-5},
\]

we first need to factor the denominator on the left side. The quadratic \(x^2 - 7x + 10\) can be factored as \((x-2)(x-5)\). Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{5x-16}{(x-2)(x-5)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-5}.
\]

Next, we will combine the right-hand side into a single fraction:

\[
\frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-5} = \frac{A(x-5) + B(x-2)}{(x-2)(x-5)}.
\]

Now, we can equate the numerators since the denominators are the same:

\[
5x - 16 = A(x - 5) + B(x - 2).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side gives:

\[
5x - 16 = Ax - 5A + Bx - 2B = (A + B)x - (5A + 2B).
\]

Now we can equate the coefficients of \(x\) and the constant terms:

1. For the coefficients of \(x\):
   \[
   A + B = 5.
   \]

2. For the constant terms:
   \[
   -5A - 2B = -16.
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(A + B = 5\)
2. \(-5A - 2B = -16\)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. Let's express \(B\) in terms of \(A\) from the first equation:

\[
B = 5 - A.
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \(B\) into the second equation:

\[
-5A - 2(5 - A) = -16.
\]

Let's simplify this equation.

Executing code:

A, B = symbols('A B')
equation1 = Eq(A + B, 5)
equation2 = Eq(-5*A - 2*B, -16)
solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (A, B))
solution

Result: {A: 2, B: 3}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After substituting \(B = 5 - A\) into the second equation and solving the system, we find:

\[
A = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad B = 3.
\]

Now, we can calculate \(A + B\):

\[
A + B = 2 + 3 = 5.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\). I hope it is correct.
