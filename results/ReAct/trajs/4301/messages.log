The length of a rectangle is twice its width. Given the length of the diagonal is $5\sqrt{5}$, find the area of the rectangle.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \). According to the problem, the length \( l \) is twice the width, so we can express the length as:

\[
l = 2w
\]

The diagonal \( d \) of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]

We know that the diagonal is given as \( 5\sqrt{5} \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
5\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{(2w)^2 + w^2}
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

\[
(2w)^2 + w^2 = 4w^2 + w^2 = 5w^2
\]

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
5\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{5w^2}
\]

Next, we will square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(5\sqrt{5})^2 = (5w^2)
\]

Now, let's calculate \( (5\sqrt{5})^2 \) and simplify the equation.

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

w = symbols('w')
equation = Eq((5*sqrt(5))**2, 5*w**2)
solve(equation, w)

Result: [-5, 5]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After squaring both sides, we found the equation:

\[
25 \cdot 5 = 5w^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
125 = 5w^2
\]

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:

\[
25 = w^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
w = 5 \quad \text{(we discard the negative solution)}
\]

Now that we have the width \( w = 5 \), we can find the length \( l \):

\[
l = 2w = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we can calculate the area \( A \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
A = 10 \times 5
\]

Now, let's calculate the area.

Executing code:
10 * 5

Result: 50
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is:

\[
A = 10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{50}\). I hope it is correct.
