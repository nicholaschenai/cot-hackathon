## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

================================ Human Message =================================

A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the number of distinct arrangements of the trees, we can use the formula for permutations of multiset. The formula is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots \) are the counts of each distinct item.

In this case, we have:
- 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees
- 5 identical Bartlett pear trees

So, the total number of trees \( n \) is:

\[
n = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

Now, we can identify \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \):
- \( n_1 = 2 \) (for the apple trees)
- \( n_2 = 5 \) (for the pear trees)

Now, we can set up the formula:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 5!}
\]

Next, I will calculate this expression step by step.

 Call ID: call_6xGsqNW6Q4Oe9F2QSy3EefqN
  Args:
    code: from sympy import factorial
n = 7
n1 = 2
n2 = 5
arrangements = factorial(n) / (factorial(n1) * factorial(n2))
arrangements
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

n = 7
n1 = 2
n2 = 5
arrangements = factorial(n) / (factorial(n1) * factorial(n2))
arrangements

Result: 21
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After calculating the expression, we find that the number of distinct arrangements of the trees is 21.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.
