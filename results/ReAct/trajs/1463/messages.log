Bag A contains $3$ white and $2$ red balls. Bag B contains $6$ white and $3$ red balls. One of the two bags will be chosen at random, and then two balls will be drawn from that bag at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color? Express your answer as a common fraction. [asy] size(140); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); pen darkness = linewidth(1.2);

To find the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the total number of balls in each bag**:
   - Bag A has \(3\) white and \(2\) red balls, so the total is \(3 + 2 = 5\) balls.
   - Bag B has \(6\) white and \(3\) red balls, so the total is \(6 + 3 = 9\) balls.

2. **Calculate the probability of choosing each bag**:
   Since one of the two bags is chosen at random, the probability of choosing Bag A is \(\frac{1}{2}\) and the probability of choosing Bag B is also \(\frac{1}{2}\).

3. **Calculate the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from each bag**:
   - For Bag A:
     - The probability of drawing 2 white balls:
       \[
       P(\text{2 white from A}) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{10}
       \]
     - The probability of drawing 2 red balls:
       \[
       P(\text{2 red from A}) = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}
       \]
     - Therefore, the total probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag A is:
       \[
       P(\text{same color from A}) = P(\text{2 white from A}) + P(\text{2 red from A}) = \frac{3}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
       \]

   - For Bag B:
     - The probability of drawing 2 white balls:
       \[
       P(\text{2 white from B}) = \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{5}{8} = \frac{30}{72} = \frac{5}{12}
       \]
     - The probability of drawing 2 red balls:
       \[
       P(\text{2 red from B}) = \frac{3}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{8} = \frac{6}{72} = \frac{1}{12}
       \]
     - Therefore, the total probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag B is:
       \[
       P(\text{same color from B}) = P(\text{2 white from B}) + P(\text{2 red from B}) = \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
       \]

4. **Combine the probabilities**:
   Now we can find the total probability of drawing two balls of the same color by considering both bags:
   \[
   P(\text{same color}) = P(\text{A}) \cdot P(\text{same color from A}) + P(\text{B}) \cdot P(\text{same color from B})
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   P(\text{same color}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Now, let's calculate this expression.

Result: 9/20
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After calculating the total probability of drawing two balls of the same color, we found:

\[
P(\text{same color}) = \frac{9}{20}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}\). I hope it is correct.
