Find the number of real solutions $(x,y,z,w)$ of the simultaneous equations
\begin{align*}
2y &= x + \frac{17}{x}, \\
2z &= y + \frac{17}{y}, \\
2w &= z + \frac{17}{z}, \\
2x &= w + \frac{17}{w}.
\end{align*}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the number of real solutions \((x,y,z,w)\) of the given simultaneous equations, we can start by analyzing the first equation:

\[
2y = x + \frac{17}{x}
\]

Rearranging this gives:

\[
2y - x = \frac{17}{x}
\]

Next, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = \frac{x + \frac{17}{x}}{2}
\]

Now, let's analyze the function \(f(x) = x + \frac{17}{x}\). We will find its critical points to understand its behavior. 

To do this, we can compute the derivative \(f'(x)\) and set it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 1 - \frac{17}{x^2}
\]

Setting \(f'(x) = 0\):

\[
1 - \frac{17}{x^2} = 0 \implies \frac{17}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 17 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{17}
\]

Next, we will evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points and also check the limits as \(x\) approaches 0 and \(\pm \infty\). 

Let's calculate \(f(\sqrt{17})\) and \(f(-\sqrt{17})\):

\[
f(\sqrt{17}) = \sqrt{17} + \frac{17}{\sqrt{17}} = \sqrt{17} + \sqrt{17} = 2\sqrt{17}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{17}) = -\sqrt{17} - \frac{17}{\sqrt{17}} = -\sqrt{17} - \sqrt{17} = -2\sqrt{17}
\]

Now, we will also check the limits:

- As \(x \to 0^+\), \(f(x) \to +\infty\).
- As \(x \to +\infty\), \(f(x) \to +\infty\).
- As \(x \to 0^-\), \(f(x) \to -\infty\).
- As \(x \to -\infty\), \(f(x) \to -\infty\).

The function \(f(x)\) has a minimum at \(x = \sqrt{17}\) with a value of \(2\sqrt{17}\) and a maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{17}\) with a value of \(-2\sqrt{17}\). 

Now, since \(y = \frac{f(x)}{2}\), we can conclude that \(y\) will take values from \(\frac{-2\sqrt{17}}{2} = -\sqrt{17}\) to \(\frac{2\sqrt{17}}{2} = \sqrt{17}\).

Next, we will analyze the second equation:

\[
2z = y + \frac{17}{y}
\]

Following the same steps, we can express \(z\) in terms of \(y\):

\[
z = \frac{y + \frac{17}{y}}{2}
\]

We can repeat this process for \(w\) in terms of \(z\) and then \(x\) in terms of \(w\). 

Now, we need to find the number of solutions for each variable. Since each variable is defined in terms of the previous one, we can conclude that the number of solutions will depend on the range of values each variable can take.

Next, we will check the behavior of the function \(g(y) = y + \frac{17}{y}\) to find the number of solutions for \(y\) and subsequently for \(z\), \(w\), and \(x\).

Let's calculate the critical points of \(g(y)\):

\[
g'(y) = 1 - \frac{17}{y^2}
\]

Setting \(g'(y) = 0\):

\[
1 - \frac{17}{y^2} = 0 \implies y^2 = 17 \implies y = \pm \sqrt{17}
\]

Now, we will evaluate \(g(y)\) at these critical points and check the limits as \(y\) approaches 0 and \(\pm \infty\).

Let's calculate \(g(\sqrt{17})\) and \(g(-\sqrt{17})\):

\[
g(\sqrt{17}) = \sqrt{17} + \frac{17}{\sqrt{17}} = 2\sqrt{17}
\]

\[
g(-\sqrt{17}) = -\sqrt{17} - \frac{17}{\sqrt{17}} = -2\sqrt{17}
\]

Now, we will also check the limits:

- As \(y \to 0^+\), \(g(y) \to +\infty\).
- As \(y \to +\infty\), \(g(y) \to +\infty\).
- As \(y \to 0^-\), \(g(y) \to -\infty\).
- As \(y \to -\infty\), \(g(y) \to -\infty\).

The function \(g(y)\) has a minimum at \(y = \sqrt{17}\) with a value of \(2\sqrt{17}\) and a maximum at \(y = -\sqrt{17}\) with a value of \(-2\sqrt{17}\). 

Thus, we can conclude that each variable \(x, y, z, w\) will have two solutions corresponding to the two critical points. 

Therefore, the total number of real solutions \((x,y,z,w)\) is \(2\) for each variable, leading to:

\[
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

Thus, the final answer is: \(\boxed{16}\). I hope it is correct.
