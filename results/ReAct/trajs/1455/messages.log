## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word CEASE.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word "CEASE", we first need to analyze the letters in the word. 

The word "CEASE" consists of 5 letters where:
- C appears 1 time
- E appears 2 times
- A appears 1 time
- S appears 1 time

Since there are repeated letters (the letter E appears twice), we will use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

In this case:
- \( n = 5 \) (total letters)
- \( n_C = 1 \) (for C)
- \( n_E = 2 \) (for E)
- \( n_A = 1 \) (for A)
- \( n_S = 1 \) (for S)

Now, we can set up the formula:

\[
\text{Number of arrangements} = \frac{5!}{1! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

Next, I will calculate \( 5! \) and the factorials of the frequencies.

Executing code:

n = 5
n_C = 1
n_E = 2
n_A = 1
n_S = 1
arrangements = sp.factorial(n) / (sp.factorial(n_C) * sp.factorial(n_E) * sp.factorial(n_A) * sp.factorial(n_S))
arrangements

Result: 60
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After calculating, we find that the number of arrangements of the letters in the word "CEASE" is 60.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.
