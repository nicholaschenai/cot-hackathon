## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the perimeter of triangle \( \triangle PQS \), we need to determine the lengths of its sides \( PQ \), \( QS \), and \( PS \).

From the diagram, we have the following information:
- \( QR = 5 \)
- \( PR = 13 \)
- \( RS = 37 \)

First, we can find the length of \( PS \) using the information about \( RS \) and \( PR \). Since \( R \) is directly below \( Q \) and \( S \) is directly below \( P \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( PS \).

Let's denote:
- \( PQ = PR + QR = 13 + 5 \)
- \( QS = QR + RS = 5 + 37 \)

Now, we will calculate \( PQ \) and \( QS \) first. 

Let's calculate \( PQ \) and \( QS \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_3eGIYiT9z9HgowikKlYx4Nol)
 Call ID: call_3eGIYiT9z9HgowikKlYx4Nol
  Args:
    code: from sympy import *
QR = 5
PR = 13
RS = 37
PQ = PR + QR
QS = QR + RS
PQ, QS
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

QR = 5
PR = 13
RS = 37
PQ = PR + QR
QS = QR + RS
PQ, QS

Result: (18, 42)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

We have calculated the lengths:
- \( PQ = 18 \)
- \( QS = 42 \)

Next, we need to find the length of \( PS \). Since \( PS \) is the vertical distance from point \( P \) to point \( S \), we can use the lengths \( QR \) and \( RS \) to find it.

The length \( PS \) can be calculated as:
\[
PS = QR + RS = 5 + 37
\]

Now, let's calculate \( PS \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_CwjWgs0RoIJMa7cZQ1cfs6aF)
 Call ID: call_CwjWgs0RoIJMa7cZQ1cfs6aF
  Args:
    code: PS = QR + RS
PS
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
PS = QR + RS
PS

Result: 42
================================== Ai Message ==================================

We have found that:
- \( PS = 42 \)

Now we have all the side lengths of triangle \( \triangle PQS \):
- \( PQ = 18 \)
- \( QS = 42 \)
- \( PS = 42 \)

To find the perimeter of triangle \( PQS \), we sum the lengths of its sides:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = PQ + QS + PS
\]

Let's calculate the perimeter.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_1P3ehGDwnUOnmdedeluMz4NU)
 Call ID: call_1P3ehGDwnUOnmdedeluMz4NU
  Args:
    code: perimeter = PQ + QS + PS
perimeter
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
perimeter = PQ + QS + PS
perimeter

Result: 102
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The perimeter of triangle \( \triangle PQS \) is \( 102 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{102}\). I hope it is correct.
