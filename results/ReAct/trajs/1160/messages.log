Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

For how many values of $x$ is the function $y=\frac{x-2}{x^2-7x+10}$ not defined?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine for how many values of \( x \) the function \( y = \frac{x-2}{x^2 - 7x + 10} \) is not defined, we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined.

First, let's analyze the denominator:

\[
x^2 - 7x + 10
\]

Next, we will set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

\[
x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0
\]

Now, I will use the quadratic formula or factor the quadratic expression to find the values of \( x \). Let's first check if it can be factored. 

The expression can be factored as:

\[
(x - a)(x - b) = 0
\]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the roots. To find \( a \) and \( b \), we need two numbers that multiply to \( 10 \) (the constant term) and add up to \( -7 \) (the coefficient of \( x \)). 

Let's find the factors of \( 10 \) and see if they meet these criteria. 

Now, I will execute the code to factor the quadratic expression.

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

x = symbols('x')
factor(x**2 - 7*x + 10)

Result: (x - 5)*(x - 2)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The quadratic expression factors to:

\[
(x - 5)(x - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us the roots:

\[
x - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 5
\]
\[
x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
\]

Thus, the function \( y = \frac{x-2}{x^2 - 7x + 10} \) is not defined for \( x = 5 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Now, we have found two values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. 

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{2}\). I hope it is correct.
