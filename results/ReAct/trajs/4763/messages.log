You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

A particle moves so that it is at $\left( 3 \sin \frac{t}{4}, 3 \cos \frac{t}{4} \right)$ at time $t.$  Find the speed of the particle, measured in unit of distance per unit of time.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the speed of the particle, we first need to determine its position as a function of time, which is given by the coordinates \( x(t) = 3 \sin \frac{t}{4} \) and \( y(t) = 3 \cos \frac{t}{4} \).

Next, we will compute the velocity components by differentiating the position functions with respect to time \( t \). The speed of the particle is then the magnitude of the velocity vector, which is given by:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2}
\]

Let's start by calculating the derivatives \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} \). 

I'll compute these derivatives now.

Executing code:


t = sp.symbols('t')

x = 3 * sp.sin(t / 4)
y = 3 * sp.cos(t / 4)

dx_dt = sp.diff(x, t)
dy_dt = sp.diff(y, t)
(dx_dt, dy_dt)

Result: (3*cos(t/4)/4, -3*sin(t/4)/4)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The derivatives we found are:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{3 \cos \frac{t}{4}}{4}
\]
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{3 \sin \frac{t}{4}}{4}
\]

Next, we will calculate the speed of the particle by finding the magnitude of the velocity vector:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2}
\]

Now, let's substitute the expressions for \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) and \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) into this formula and simplify.

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
speed = sp.sqrt((dx_dt)**2 + (dy_dt)**2)
simplified_speed = sp.simplify(speed)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The expression for the speed simplifies to:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{3 \cos \frac{t}{4}}{4} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{3 \sin \frac{t}{4}}{4} \right)^2}
\]

Now, let's simplify this expression further. 

Calculating the squares:

\[
\left( \frac{3 \cos \frac{t}{4}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{9 \cos^2 \frac{t}{4}}{16}
\]
\[
\left( -\frac{3 \sin \frac{t}{4}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{9 \sin^2 \frac{t}{4}}{16}
\]

Adding these two results together:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\frac{9 \cos^2 \frac{t}{4}}{16} + \frac{9 \sin^2 \frac{t}{4}}{16}}
\]

Factoring out the common terms gives:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{16} (\cos^2 \frac{t}{4} + \sin^2 \frac{t}{4})}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1 \), we can simplify this further. Let's compute that.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The speed simplifies to:

\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{16}} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\). I hope it is correct.
