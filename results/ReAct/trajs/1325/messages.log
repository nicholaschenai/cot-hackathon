## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

How many positive integers are less than $100\pi$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find how many positive integers are less than \(100\pi\), we first need to calculate the value of \(100\pi\). 

We know that \(\pi\) is approximately \(3.14159\). Therefore, we can multiply this value by \(100\) to get \(100\pi\).

Let's calculate \(100\pi\) first.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_if1D8YTF6173RUtFVNpI6Rbd)
 Call ID: call_if1D8YTF6173RUtFVNpI6Rbd
  Args:
    code: from sympy import pi; 100 * pi
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

100 * pi

Result: 100*pi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The value of \(100\pi\) is \(100\pi\). 

Next, we need to find the approximate numerical value of \(100\pi\) to determine how many positive integers are less than this value. 

Let's calculate the numerical approximation of \(100\pi\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_l1py5OG37mLJHfKdguhHhJBN)
 Call ID: call_l1py5OG37mLJHfKdguhHhJBN
  Args:
    code: (100 * pi).evalf()
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
(100 * pi).evalf()

Result: 314.159265358979
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The approximate value of \(100\pi\) is \(314.159265358979\).

Now, to find how many positive integers are less than \(314.159265358979\), we can simply take the floor of this value, since we are interested in positive integers.

Let's calculate the floor of \(100\pi\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_KzQtsebZqr799HvLY2cC7S3B)
 Call ID: call_KzQtsebZqr799HvLY2cC7S3B
  Args:
    code: (100 * pi).evalf().floor()
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
(100 * pi).evalf().floor()

Result: 314
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The floor of \(100\pi\) is \(314\). 

This means that the positive integers less than \(100\pi\) are the integers from \(1\) to \(314\). 

Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than \(100\pi\) is \(314\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{314}\). I hope it is correct.
