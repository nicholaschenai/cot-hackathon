Find the unique $\textbf{odd}$ integer $t$ such that $0<t<23$ and $t+2$ is the inverse of $t$ modulo $23$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we need to find an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \). 

The condition that \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo \( 23 \) can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \mod 23
\]

This means that when we multiply \( t \) by \( t + 2 \), the result should leave a remainder of \( 1 \) when divided by \( 23 \).

Let's first expand the left-hand side of the equation:

\[
t(t + 2) = t^2 + 2t
\]

Now, we need to set up the equation:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \mod 23
\]

Next, we can rearrange this equation to:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 23
\]

Now, we will solve the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 = 0 \) modulo \( 23 \). 

Let's calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Next, we will find the square root of \( 8 \) modulo \( 23 \). 

Let's check if \( 8 \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( 23 \) and find its square roots if it is. 

We will compute the values of \( x^2 \mod 23 \) for \( x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 22 \) to see if \( 8 \) appears.

The squares modulo \( 23 \) are:

\[
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 2, 13, 3, 18, 12, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 18, 3, 13, 2, 16, 9, 4, 1]
\]

From this list, we can see that \( 8 \) is indeed a quadratic residue modulo \( 23 \). The square roots of \( 8 \) modulo \( 23 \) are \( 11 \) and \( 12 \) (since \( 11^2 \equiv 8 \mod 23 \) and \( 12^2 \equiv 8 \mod 23 \)).

Now, we can use these square roots to find the solutions for \( t \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Substituting the square roots we found:

1. For \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 11 \mod 23 \):

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{-2 - 11}{2}
\]

Calculating these:

\[
t_1 = \frac{9}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad t_2 = \frac{-13}{2}
\]

2. For \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 12 \mod 23 \):

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 12}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad t = \frac{-2 - 12}{2}
\]

Calculating these:

\[
t_3 = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad t_4 = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
\]

Now, we need to check which of these values are odd integers in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \). 

The candidates we have are \( 5 \) and \( 9 \) (from \( t_1 \)), and we will check if they satisfy the original condition. 

Let's check \( t = 5 \):

\[
t + 2 = 7
\]
\[
5 \cdot 7 = 35 \equiv 12 \mod 23 \quad \text{(not 1)}
\]

Now let's check \( t = 9 \):

\[
t + 2 = 11
\]
\[
9 \cdot 11 = 99 \equiv 8 \mod 23 \quad \text{(not 1)}
\]

Now let's check \( t = 11 \):

\[
t + 2 = 13
\]
\[
11 \cdot 13 = 143 \equiv 1 \mod 23 \quad \text{(this works)}
\]

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the conditions is \( 11 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{11}\). I hope it is correct.
