Let $\ell$ be the line in space through the points $(0,0,1)$ and $(1,1,1).$  Let $d$ be the length of the shortest possible path that begins at the origin, travels to a point on $\ell,$ then ends at the point $(1,0,0).$  Enter $d^2.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the shortest path from the origin \((0,0,0)\) to the line \(\ell\) and then to the point \((1,0,0)\), we first need to determine the parametric equation of the line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \((0,0,1)\) and \((1,1,1)\).

The direction vector of the line can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two points:

\[
(1,1,1) - (0,0,1) = (1,1,0).
\]

Thus, the parametric equations for the line \(\ell\) can be expressed as:

\[
\ell(t) = (0,0,1) + t(1,1,0) = (t, t, 1).
\]

Next, we need to find a point on the line \(\ell\) that minimizes the total distance from the origin to this point and then to \((1,0,0)\). 

Let the point on the line be \((t, t, 1)\). The distance from the origin to this point is given by:

\[
d_1 = \sqrt{t^2 + t^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2t^2 + 1}.
\]

The distance from the point \((t, t, 1)\) to \((1,0,0)\) is:

\[
d_2 = \sqrt{(t-1)^2 + (t-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \sqrt{(t-1)^2 + t^2 + 1}.
\]

Now, we can express the total distance \(d\) as:

\[
d = d_1 + d_2 = \sqrt{2t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{(t-1)^2 + t^2 + 1}.
\]

To minimize \(d\), we can minimize \(d^2\) instead, which is often easier. Thus, we will compute \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = \left(\sqrt{2t^2 + 1} + \sqrt{(t-1)^2 + t^2 + 1}\right)^2.
\]

Expanding this expression will help us find the minimum value. 

Let's first compute \(d_2\):

\[
d_2 = \sqrt{(t-1)^2 + t^2 + 1} = \sqrt{(t^2 - 2t + 1) + t^2 + 1} = \sqrt{2t^2 - 2t + 2}.
\]

Now we can express \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = (2t^2 + 1) + (2t^2 - 2t + 2) + 2\sqrt{(2t^2 + 1)(2t^2 - 2t + 2)}.
\]

Now, let's simplify this expression and find the minimum value of \(d^2\). 

I will compute \(d^2\) and then find its minimum.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The expression for \(d^2\) has been simplified to:

\[
d^2 = 4t^2 - 2t + 2\sqrt{(2t^2 + 1)(2t^2 - 2t + 2)} + 3.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(t\) that minimizes this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative of \(d^2\) with respect to \(t\) and set it to zero to find the critical points.

Let's compute the derivative of \(d^2\) and solve for \(t\).
