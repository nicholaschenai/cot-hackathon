You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

In $\triangle{XYZ}$, $\angle{Z}=90^{\circ}$, $\cos{Y}=\frac{7}{25}$, and $XY=25$.  What is $\tan{X}$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

In triangle \( XYZ \), we know that \( \angle Z = 90^\circ \), which means it is a right triangle. We are given that \( \cos Y = \frac{7}{25} \) and the length of the hypotenuse \( XY = 25 \).

From the definition of cosine in a right triangle, we have:

\[
\cos Y = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{XZ}{XY}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\frac{7}{25} = \frac{XZ}{25}
\]

From this, we can find the length of side \( XZ \):

\[
XZ = 7
\]

Next, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side \( YZ \):

\[
XY^2 = XZ^2 + YZ^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
25^2 = 7^2 + YZ^2
\]

Now, let's calculate \( YZ^2 \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_YAibztSx9fCbKE7DL2BzSWHF)
 Call ID: call_YAibztSx9fCbKE7DL2BzSWHF
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
YZ = symbols('YZ')
equation = Eq(25**2, 7**2 + YZ**2)
YZ_squared = solve(equation, YZ)[0]
YZ_squared
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

YZ = symbols('YZ')
equation = Eq(25**2, 7**2 + YZ**2)
YZ_squared = solve(equation, YZ)[0]
YZ_squared

Result: -24
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems I made an error in interpreting the result. The calculation should yield a positive value for \( YZ \). Let's re-evaluate the equation:

\[
25^2 = 7^2 + YZ^2
\]

Calculating \( 25^2 \) and \( 7^2 \):

\[
625 = 49 + YZ^2
\]

Now, rearranging to find \( YZ^2 \):

\[
YZ^2 = 625 - 49
\]

Let's compute \( YZ^2 \) correctly this time.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_q8b3mLVGpjl8jMnzKM2sDcaK)
 Call ID: call_q8b3mLVGpjl8jMnzKM2sDcaK
  Args:
    code: YZ_squared_correct = 625 - 49
YZ_squared_correct
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
YZ_squared_correct = 625 - 49
YZ_squared_correct

Result: 576
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Now we have:

\[
YZ^2 = 576
\]

Taking the square root to find \( YZ \):

\[
YZ = \sqrt{576} = 24
\]

Now we have the lengths of both sides adjacent to angle \( X \):
- \( XZ = 7 \)
- \( YZ = 24 \)

Next, we can find \( \tan X \) using the definition of tangent:

\[
\tan X = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{YZ}{XZ}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\tan X = \frac{24}{7}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{24}{7}}\). I hope it is correct.
