## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Tamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine how many boxes Tamantha needs to buy, we first need to divide the total number of compact discs (77) by the number of discs each box can hold (12). 

Next, we will perform the division and check if there is a remainder. If there is a remainder, it means she will need an additional box to accommodate the leftover discs.

Let's calculate \( \frac{77}{12} \) to find out how many boxes she needs.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_FVViV3yevUI0KZTqLh77jyHc)
 Call ID: call_FVViV3yevUI0KZTqLh77jyHc
  Args:
    code: import sympy as sp
boxes_needed = sp.ceiling(77 / 12)
boxes_needed
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

boxes_needed = sp.ceiling(77 / 12)
boxes_needed

Result: 7
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After performing the calculation, we find that Tamantha needs 7 boxes to hold all 77 compact discs. 

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.
