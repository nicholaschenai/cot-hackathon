## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Compute
\[\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ -7 & 4 & 2 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.\]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To compute the product of the matrix 

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ -7 & 4 & 2 \\ 0 & 5 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

and the vector 

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we will perform matrix multiplication. The resulting vector will have the same number of rows as the matrix and will be computed by taking the dot product of each row of the matrix with the vector.

Let's denote the matrix as \( A \) and the vector as \( \mathbf{b} \). The resulting vector \( \mathbf{c} = A \mathbf{b} \) will be computed as follows:

1. The first element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is obtained by multiplying the first row of \( A \) with \( \mathbf{b} \).
2. The second element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is obtained by multiplying the second row of \( A \) with \( \mathbf{b} \).
3. The third element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is obtained by multiplying the third row of \( A \) with \( \mathbf{b} \).

Let's calculate each of these elements step by step. 

First, I will calculate the first element of the resulting vector \( \mathbf{c} \). 

The first row of \( A \) is \( (3, 1, 0) \) and the vector \( \mathbf{b} \) is \( (4, -1, -2) \). 

The first element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is:

\[
3 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot (-2).
\]

Now, I will execute this calculation.

Result: 11
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The first element of the resulting vector \( \mathbf{c} \) is \( 11 \).

Next, I will calculate the second element of \( \mathbf{c} \). 

The second row of \( A \) is \( (-7, 4, 2) \). 

The second element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is:

\[
-7 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot (-1) + 2 \cdot (-2).
\]

Now, I will execute this calculation.

Result: -36
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The second element of the resulting vector \( \mathbf{c} \) is \( -36 \).

Now, I will calculate the third element of \( \mathbf{c} \). 

The third row of \( A \) is \( (0, 5, -1) \). 

The third element of \( \mathbf{c} \) is:

\[
0 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-2).
\]

Now, I will execute this calculation.

0*4 + 5*(-1) + (-1)*(-2)

Result: -3
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The third element of the resulting vector \( \mathbf{c} \) is \( -3 \).

Now, we can combine all the elements we calculated to form the resulting vector:

\[
\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 11 \\ -36 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 11 \\ -36 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}}\). I hope it is correct.
