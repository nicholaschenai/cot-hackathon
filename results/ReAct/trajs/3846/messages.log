## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Two numbers are said to be 'relatively prime' if their greatest common factor is 1. How many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime with 28?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine how many integers greater than 10 and less than 30 are relatively prime to 28, we first need to find the prime factorization of 28. 

The prime factorization of 28 is:
\[ 28 = 2^2 \times 7 \]

Next, we will identify the integers in the range from 11 to 29 (inclusive) and check which of these integers do not share any prime factors with 28. 

The integers in this range are:
\[ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 \]

Now, we will check each of these integers to see if they are relatively prime to 28 by ensuring that they do not have 2 or 7 as factors. 

Let's start by listing the integers in the specified range and checking their factors. 

I will now execute the code to find the integers in the range and check their factors.

relatively_prime_numbers = []

# Check each number in the range
for num in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
    if gcd(num, 28) == 1:
        relatively_prime_numbers.append(num)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The integers greater than 10 and less than 30 that are relatively prime to 28 are:
\[ 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29 \]

Now, let's count these integers to find the total number of integers that are relatively prime to 28 in this range.

The list contains 9 integers. 

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.
