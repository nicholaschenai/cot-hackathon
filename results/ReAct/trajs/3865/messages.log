## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What is $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}$ is equal to?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, I will first observe the fractions involved. The fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{4}\), and \(\frac{1}{8}\) have different denominators. To add them together, I need to find a common denominator.

The denominators are 2, 4, and 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 8. 

Next, I will convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8:

- \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{8}\)
- \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8}\)
- \(\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8}\)

Now, I will add these fractions together. 

Let's execute the addition of these fractions.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_iyWGAAeuYcetrQInZXtcgpAh)
 Call ID: call_iyWGAAeuYcetrQInZXtcgpAh
  Args:
    code: from sympy import Rational; sum_fractions = Rational(1, 2) + Rational(1, 4) + Rational(1, 8); sum_fractions
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

sum_fractions = Rational(1, 2) + Rational(1, 4) + Rational(1, 8)
sum_fractions

Result: 7/8
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After converting the fractions to a common denominator and adding them, I found that:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{7}{8}}\). I hope it is correct.
