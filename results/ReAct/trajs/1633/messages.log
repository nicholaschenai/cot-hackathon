Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

How many multiples of $9^3$ are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find how many multiples of \(9^3\) are greater than \(9^4\) and less than \(9^5\), we can start by expressing the multiples of \(9^3\) in the form \(k \cdot 9^3\), where \(k\) is a positive integer.

Next, we need to determine the range for \(k\) such that:

\[
9^4 < k \cdot 9^3 < 9^5
\]

We can simplify this inequality by dividing all parts by \(9^3\):

\[
\frac{9^4}{9^3} < k < \frac{9^5}{9^3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9 < k < 9^2
\]

Now, we can calculate \(9^2\):

\[
9^2 = 81
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
9 < k < 81
\]

The integers \(k\) that satisfy this inequality are \(10, 11, 12, \ldots, 80\). 

Next, we need to find how many integers are in this range. The smallest integer is \(10\) and the largest is \(80\). 

To find the count of integers from \(10\) to \(80\), we can use the formula for counting integers in a range:

\[
\text{Count} = \text{Largest} - \text{Smallest} + 1
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Count} = 80 - 10 + 1
\]

Now, I will calculate this value.

The count of integers \(k\) that satisfy the inequality \(9 < k < 81\) is \(71\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{71}\). I hope it is correct.
