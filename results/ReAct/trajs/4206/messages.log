## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Solve for $k$ in the equation $2k+5 = 13$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve for \( k \) in the equation \( 2k + 5 = 13 \), I will first isolate the term containing \( k \). 

The first step is to subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. This will help me eliminate the constant on the left side.

Let's perform this operation.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_esRmzJTfovwVoHOA88vur359)
 Call ID: call_esRmzJTfovwVoHOA88vur359
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
k = symbols('k')
equation = Eq(2*k + 5, 13)
step1 = Eq(2*k + 5 - 5, 13 - 5)
step1
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

k = symbols('k')
equation = Eq(2*k + 5, 13)
step1 = Eq(2*k + 5 - 5, 13 - 5)
step1

Result: Eq(2*k, 8)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After subtracting 5 from both sides, the equation simplifies to \( 2k = 8 \).

Next, I will divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \( k \). Let's perform this operation.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_o5c8Xc6RiPTYUZhvVFWwl7wy)
 Call ID: call_o5c8Xc6RiPTYUZhvVFWwl7wy
  Args:
    code: step2 = Eq(2*k / 2, 8 / 2)
step2
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
step2 = Eq(2*k / 2, 8 / 2)
step2

Result: Eq(k, 4.0)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After dividing both sides by 2, we find that \( k = 4.0 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\). I hope it is correct.
