Find the ordered pair $(m,n),$ where $m,n$ are positive integers satisfying the following equation:
$$6mn = 27 - 3m - 2n$$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation \(6mn = 27 - 3m - 2n\), we can start by rearranging it to isolate the terms involving \(m\) and \(n\) on one side. 

First, let's rewrite the equation:

\[
6mn + 3m + 2n = 27
\]

Next, we can factor the left-hand side to make it easier to analyze. However, it might be more straightforward to express \(n\) in terms of \(m\) or vice versa. 

Let's isolate \(n\):

\[
6mn + 2n = 27 - 3m
\]

Factoring out \(n\) gives us:

\[
n(6m + 2) = 27 - 3m
\]

Now, we can express \(n\) as:

\[
n = \frac{27 - 3m}{6m + 2}
\]

Next, we need to ensure that \(n\) is a positive integer. This means that \(27 - 3m\) must be positive and divisible by \(6m + 2\). 

Let's analyze the conditions for \(m\):

1. \(27 - 3m > 0\) implies \(m < 9\).
2. \(6m + 2\) must divide \(27 - 3m\).

Now, let's check the values of \(m\) from 1 to 8 and see if \(n\) is a positive integer for those values. 

I'll calculate \(n\) for each integer \(m\) from 1 to 8.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The calculations for \(n\) based on the values of \(m\) from 1 to 8 yield the following results:

- For \(m = 1\), \(n = 3\)
- For \(m = 2\), \(n = 1.5\)
- For \(m = 3\), \(n = 0.9\)
- For \(m = 4\), \(n \approx 0.577\)
- For \(m = 5\), \(n = 0.375\)
- For \(m = 6\), \(n \approx 0.237\)
- For \(m = 7\), \(n \approx 0.136\)
- For \(m = 8\), \(n \approx 0.060\)

From these results, we can see that only when \(m = 1\) do we get a positive integer value for \(n\), which is \(n = 3\).

Thus, the ordered pair \((m, n)\) that satisfies the equation is \((1, 3)\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{(1, 3)}\). I hope it is correct.
