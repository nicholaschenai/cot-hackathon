Find the constant $c$ such that $$(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0$$ for all $x.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the constant \( c \) such that 

\[
(x^2-4x+3)(x+5) - (x^2+4x-5)(x-c)=0
\]

for all \( x \), we can start by expanding both sides of the equation.

First, let's expand \( (x^2-4x+3)(x+5) \):

1. Distributing \( x^2 \):
   \[
   x^2 \cdot x + x^2 \cdot 5 = x^3 + 5x^2
   \]

2. Distributing \( -4x \):
   \[
   -4x \cdot x - 4x \cdot 5 = -4x^2 - 20x
   \]

3. Distributing \( 3 \):
   \[
   3 \cdot x + 3 \cdot 5 = 3x + 15
   \]

Now, combining all these terms together:

\[
x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x^2 - 20x + 3x + 15 = x^3 + (5x^2 - 4x^2) + (-20x + 3x) + 15
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15
\]

Next, we will expand \( (x^2+4x-5)(x-c) \):

1. Distributing \( x^2 \):
   \[
   x^2 \cdot x - x^2 \cdot c = x^3 - cx^2
   \]

2. Distributing \( 4x \):
   \[
   4x \cdot x - 4x \cdot c = 4x^2 - 4cx
   \]

3. Distributing \( -5 \):
   \[
   -5 \cdot x + 5 \cdot c = -5x + 5c
   \]

Now, combining these terms:

\[
x^3 - cx^2 + 4x^2 - 4cx - 5x + 5c = x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-4c - 5)x + 5c
\]

Now we have both expansions:

1. From the first expression: \( x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 \)
2. From the second expression: \( x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-4c - 5)x + 5c \)

Setting these equal to each other gives us:

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 17x + 15 = x^3 + (-c + 4)x^2 + (-4c - 5)x + 5c
\]

Now, we can equate the coefficients of \( x^2 \), \( x \), and the constant term.

1. For \( x^2 \):
   \[
   1 = -c + 4
   \]

2. For \( x \):
   \[
   -17 = -4c - 5
   \]

3. For the constant term:
   \[
   15 = 5c
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step, starting with the first equation. 

From \( 1 = -c + 4 \):

\[
c = 4 - 1 = 3
\]

Now, let's check if this value of \( c \) satisfies the other equations. 

Next, we will substitute \( c = 3 \) into the second equation:

\[
-17 = -4(3) - 5
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
-4(3) - 5 = -12 - 5 = -17
\]

This holds true.

Now, let's check the third equation:

\[
15 = 5(3)
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
5(3) = 15
\]

This also holds true.

Since all equations are satisfied with \( c = 3 \), we conclude that:

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
