Let $m$ be a constant not equal to $0$ or $1.$ Then the graph of \[x^2 + my^2 = 4\]is a conic section with two foci. Find all values of $m$ such that the foci both lie on the circle $x^2+y^2=16.$

Enter all possible values of $m,$ separated by commas.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the values of \( m \) such that the foci of the conic section given by the equation \( x^2 + my^2 = 4 \) lie on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \), we first need to identify the type of conic section represented by the equation.

1. **Identify the conic section**: The equation \( x^2 + my^2 = 4 \) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{\frac{4}{m}} = 1
   \]
   This is the standard form of an ellipse if \( m > 0 \) and \( m \neq 1 \). If \( m < 0 \), it represents a hyperbola.

2. **Find the foci**: For an ellipse, the foci are located at \( (c, 0) \) and \( (-c, 0) \), where \( c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} \). Here, \( a^2 = 4 \) and \( b^2 = \frac{4}{m} \). Thus, we have:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4}{m}} = \sqrt{4\left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)} = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}
   \]
   The foci are at \( (2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}, 0) \) and \( (-2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}}, 0) \).

3. **Condition for foci on the circle**: The foci must lie on the circle defined by \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \). Since the foci are on the x-axis, we only need to check the x-coordinates:
   \[
   (2\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{m}})^2 + 0^2 = 16
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   4(1 - \frac{1}{m}) = 16
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{m} = 4
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   -\frac{1}{m} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = -\frac{1}{3}
   \]

4. **Check if \( m = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid**: Since \( m \) must not equal \( 0 \) or \( 1 \), \( m = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid.

5. **Conclusion**: The only value of \( m \) that satisfies the conditions of the problem is \( -\frac{1}{3} \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}\). I hope it is correct.
