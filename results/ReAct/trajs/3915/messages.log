## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What is the value of $x$ in the equation $3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation \(3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23\), I will first simplify the left side of the equation. 

The term \(3(1+x)\) can be expanded. 

Let's perform that expansion and simplify the equation step by step. 

I will execute the code to expand and simplify the left side.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_RP95zuKJVRpsn3zbY7IXoWGT)
 Call ID: call_RP95zuKJVRpsn3zbY7IXoWGT
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, expand, Eq, solve
x = symbols('x')
equation = Eq(3*x + 2 + 3*(1 + x), 23)
expanded_equation = expand(equation.lhs)
expanded_equation
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

x = symbols('x')
equation = Eq(3*x + 2 + 3*(1 + x), 23)
expanded_equation = expand(equation.lhs)
expanded_equation

Result: 6*x + 5
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After expanding the left side of the equation, we have:

\[
6x + 5 = 23
\]

Next, I will isolate \(x\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. 

Let's perform that subtraction.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_d6rOsYRbGhq3Ohj82w21zCFm)
 Call ID: call_d6rOsYRbGhq3Ohj82w21zCFm
  Args:
    code: solved_equation = Eq(expanded_equation, 23)
solved_equation = Eq(solved_equation.lhs - 5, 23 - 5)
solved_equation
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
solved_equation = Eq(expanded_equation, 23)
solved_equation = Eq(solved_equation.lhs - 5, 23 - 5)
solved_equation

Result: Eq(6*x, 18)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After subtracting 5 from both sides, we have:

\[
6x = 18
\]

Now, I will solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 6. 

Let's perform that division.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_8Ye7RH71BrlXhWjIrTtSlASB)
 Call ID: call_8Ye7RH71BrlXhWjIrTtSlASB
  Args:
    code: x_value = solve(Eq(6*x, 18), x)
x_value
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
x_value = solve(Eq(6*x, 18), x)
x_value

Result: [3]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[
x = 3
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
