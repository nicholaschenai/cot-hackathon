To solve the problem, we first need to establish the coordinates of the points in rectangle \(ABCD\).

1. **Assign Coordinates**:
   - Let \(A = (0, 0)\)
   - \(B = (8, 0)\)
   - \(C = (8, 9)\)
   - \(D = (0, 9)\)

Next, we can find the coordinates of points \(H\) and \(E\).

2. **Find Coordinates of \(H\)**:
   - Since \(H\) is on \(\overline{BC}\) and \(BH = 6\), we can find \(H\) as follows:
     - The coordinates of \(H\) are \(H = (8, 6)\).

3. **Find Coordinates of \(E\)**:
   - Since \(E\) is on \(\overline{AD}\) and \(DE = 4\), we can find \(E\) as follows:
     - The coordinates of \(E\) are \(E = (0, 5)\).

Now we have the coordinates of all relevant points:
- \(A = (0, 0)\)
- \(B = (8, 0)\)
- \(C = (8, 9)\)
- \(D = (0, 9)\)
- \(H = (8, 6)\)
- \(E = (0, 5)\)

Next, we need to find the equations of lines \(EC\) and \(AH\).

4. **Find the Equation of Line \(EC\)**:
   - The slope of line \(EC\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{slope of } EC = \frac{9 - 5}{8 - 0} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Using point-slope form with point \(E(0, 5)\):
     \[
     y - 5 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + 5
     \]

5. **Find the Equation of Line \(AH\)**:
   - The slope of line \(AH\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{slope of } AH = \frac{6 - 0}{8 - 0} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
     \]
   - Using point-slope form with point \(A(0, 0)\):
     \[
     y - 0 = \frac{3}{4}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{3}{4}x
     \]

Next, we need to find the intersection point \(G\) of lines \(EC\) and \(AH\).

6. **Find Intersection Point \(G\)**:
   - Set the equations equal to each other:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2}x + 5 = \frac{3}{4}x
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     5 = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{1}{2}x
     \]
   - Converting \(\frac{1}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
     \[
     5 = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{2}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 20
     \]
   - Substituting \(x = 20\) back into the equation of line \(AH\) to find \(y\):
     \[
     y = \frac{3}{4}(20) = 15
     \]
   - Thus, \(G = (20, 15)\).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of point \(F\) on line \(AD\) such that \(\overline{GF} \perp \overline{AF}\).

7. **Find Coordinates of \(F\)**:
   - Since \(F\) is on line \(AD\), its coordinates can be expressed as \(F = (0, y_F)\).
   - The slope of line \(AF\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } AF = \frac{y_F - 0}{0 - 0} = \text{undefined (vertical line)}
     \]
   - The slope of line \(GF\) is:
     \[
     \text{slope of } GF = \frac{y_F - 15}{0 - 20} = \frac{y_F - 15}{-20}
     \]
   - For \(GF\) to be perpendicular to \(AF\), the slope of \(GF\) must be 0 (horizontal line):
     \[
     y_F - 15 = 0 \implies y_F = 15
     \]
   - Thus, \(F = (0, 15)\).

Finally, we can find the length of \(\overline{GF}\).

8. **Calculate Length \(\overline{GF}\)**:
   - The coordinates of \(G\) are \((20, 15)\) and the coordinates of \(F\) are \((0, 15)\).
   - The length \(\overline{GF}\) is the horizontal distance between \(G\) and \(F\):
     \[
     GF = |20 - 0| = 20
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{20}\). I hope it is correct.
