What is the sum of all of the multiples of 3 between 100 and 200?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200, we first need to identify the smallest and largest multiples of 3 within this range.

1. **Finding the smallest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 100**:
   - We can do this by dividing 100 by 3 and rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by 3.

2. **Finding the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 200**:
   - Similarly, we divide 200 by 3 and round down to the nearest whole number, then multiply by 3.

Let's start with the first step to find the smallest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 100. 

I'll calculate \( \lceil \frac{100}{3} \rceil \times 3 \).

 Call ID: call_SIxPAvu1sV4lucpe6PaXOi21

    code: import sympy as sp
smallest_multiple = sp.ceiling(100 / 3) * 3

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

smallest_multiple = sp.ceiling(100 / 3) * 3
smallest_multiple

Result: 102
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The smallest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 100 is 102.

Next, let's find the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 200. We will calculate \( \lfloor \frac{200}{3} \rfloor \times 3 \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_EMFjhJkANViGBE8B1yjJERwL)
 Call ID: call_EMFjhJkANViGBE8B1yjJERwL
  Args:
    code: largest_multiple = sp.floor(200 / 3) * 3
largest_multiple
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
largest_multiple = sp.floor(200 / 3) * 3
largest_multiple

Result: 198
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 200 is 198.

Now we have the range of multiples of 3 between 100 and 200, which are from 102 to 198. 

Next, we need to determine how many multiples of 3 are in this range. The multiples of 3 can be expressed as:
- \( 3n \) where \( n \) is an integer.

To find the values of \( n \) for our range:
- For the smallest multiple (102), we can find \( n \) by solving \( 3n = 102 \).
- For the largest multiple (198), we can find \( n \) by solving \( 3n = 198 \).

Let's calculate the values of \( n \) for both the smallest and largest multiples.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_tKnfZGCY6xbyAbxmk4rAjoLa)
 Call ID: call_tKnfZGCY6xbyAbxmk4rAjoLa
  Args:
    code: n_smallest = 102 / 3
n_largest = 198 / 3
n_smallest, n_largest
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
n_smallest = 102 / 3
n_largest = 198 / 3
n_smallest, n_largest

Result: (34.0, 66.0)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The value of \( n \) for the smallest multiple (102) is 34, and for the largest multiple (198) is 66. 

Now, we can find the total number of multiples of 3 between 102 and 198 by calculating the difference between these two values and adding 1 (to include both endpoints):

\[
\text{Number of multiples} = n_{\text{largest}} - n_{\text{smallest}} + 1 = 66 - 34 + 1
\]

Let's calculate this.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_j4jWYJXabF5TEes9k2qsCuO1)
 Call ID: call_j4jWYJXabF5TEes9k2qsCuO1
  Args:
    code: number_of_multiples = 66 - 34 + 1
number_of_multiples
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
number_of_multiples = 66 - 34 + 1
number_of_multiples

Result: 33
================================== Ai Message ==================================

There are 33 multiples of 3 between 102 and 198.

Next, we can find the sum of these multiples. The multiples of 3 from 102 to 198 form an arithmetic series where:
- The first term \( a = 102 \)
- The last term \( l = 198 \)
- The number of terms \( n = 33 \)

The sum \( S \) of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum using this formula.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_uRFNy6ELDK8tERZLkjGYI6EJ)
 Call ID: call_uRFNy6ELDK8tERZLkjGYI6EJ
  Args:
    code: a = 102
l = 198
n = 33
sum_multiples = (n / 2) * (a + l)
sum_multiples
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
a = 102
l = 198
n = 33
sum_multiples = (n / 2) * (a + l)
sum_multiples

Result: 4950.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The sum of all multiples of 3 between 100 and 200 is 4950.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{4950}$. I hope it is correct.
