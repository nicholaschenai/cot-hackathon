You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

================================ Human Message =================================

Adina and Lynn are going rock-climbing and need to rent special shoes. Lynn is normally size 9 and knows that her rock-climbing shoe-size is 42. If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between normal shoe sizes and rock-climbing shoe sizes. We know that Lynn's normal shoe size is 9 and her rock-climbing shoe size is 42. 

Since the shoe sizes are directly proportional, we can set up a proportion to find Adina's rock-climbing shoe size based on her normal shoe size of 6.

Let's denote:
- Lynn's normal shoe size as \( L_n = 9 \)
- Lynn's rock-climbing shoe size as \( L_r = 42 \)
- Adina's normal shoe size as \( A_n = 6 \)
- Adina's rock-climbing shoe size as \( A_r \)

The proportion can be set up as follows:

\[
\frac{L_r}{L_n} = \frac{A_r}{A_n}
\]

Now, we can substitute the known values into the equation:

\[
\frac{42}{9} = \frac{A_r}{6}
\]

Next, we will solve for \( A_r \). 

Let's execute the calculation to find \( A_r \).

Result: 28.0000000000000
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After solving the proportion, we found that Adina's rock-climbing shoe size \( A_r \) is 28.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.
