The parametric curve $(x,y) = (\sin t, \sin 2t)$ is plotted below.

[asy]
unitsize(2 cm);

pair moo (real t) {
  return (sin(t),sin(2*t));
}

real t;
path foo = moo(0);

for (t = 0; t <= 2*pi + 0.1; t = t + 0.1) {
  foo = foo--moo(t);
}

draw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0));
draw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2));
draw(foo,red);
[/asy]

This curve can also be expressed in the form
\[ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0,\]where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers.  Find the smallest possible value of $a + b + c.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To express the parametric curve \((x,y) = (\sin t, \sin 2t)\) in the form \(ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0\), we start by substituting the parametric equations into the expression for \(y\).

First, we know that:
- \(x = \sin t\)
- \(y = \sin 2t\)

Using the double angle identity for sine, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
\sin 2t = 2 \sin t \cos t
\]
Substituting \(x\) into this equation gives:
\[
y = 2x \cos t
\]

Next, we need to express \(\cos t\) in terms of \(x\). We can use the Pythagorean identity:
\[
\cos^2 t = 1 - \sin^2 t = 1 - x^2
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\cos t = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
Now substituting this back into the equation for \(y\):
\[
y = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Next, we will square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[
y^2 = (2x \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
y^2 = 4x^2(1 - x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^4
\]

Rearranging this gives:
\[
4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0
\]

Now, we can identify the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
- \(a = 4\)
- \(b = 4\)
- \(c = 1\)

Now we can find the sum \(a + b + c\):
\[
a + b + c = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{9}\). I hope it is correct.
