The greatest common divisor of two positive integers less than $100$ is equal to $3$. Their least common multiple is twelve times one of the integers. What is the largest possible sum of the two integers?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by letting the two integers be \( a \) and \( b \). We know the following:

1. \( \gcd(a, b) = 3 \)
2. \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = 12a \) (or equivalently \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = 12b \))
3. Both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

From the properties of gcd and lcm, we have the relationship:

\[
\text{lcm}(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, b) = a \cdot b
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
12a \cdot 3 = a \cdot b
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
36a = a \cdot b
\]

Assuming \( a \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( a \):

\[
b = 36
\]

Now, since \( \gcd(a, b) = 3 \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( k \):

\[
a = 3k
\]

where \( k \) is a positive integer. Since \( b = 36 \), we need to ensure that \( \gcd(3k, 36) = 3 \). This means that \( k \) must be coprime to \( 12 \) (since \( 36 = 3 \times 12 \)).

Next, we need to find the possible values of \( k \) such that \( 3k < 100 \):

\[
k < \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
\]

Thus, \( k \) can take integer values from \( 1 \) to \( 33 \). We also need \( k \) to be coprime to \( 12 \). The integers from \( 1 \) to \( 33 \) that are coprime to \( 12 \) can be found by checking each integer.

Let's find the integers \( k \) that are coprime to \( 12 \) (which has prime factors \( 2 \) and \( 3 \)). The integers that are not coprime to \( 12 \) are those that are multiples of \( 2 \) or \( 3 \).

Now, I will calculate the integers from \( 1 \) to \( 33 \) that are coprime to \( 12 \).

The integers from \( 1 \) to \( 33 \) that are coprime to \( 12 \) are:

\[
k = [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31]
\]

Now, we can calculate the corresponding values of \( a \) for each \( k \):

\[
a = 3k
\]

Next, we will compute \( a \) for each \( k \) and then find the sum \( a + b \) where \( b = 36 \). We will also ensure that \( a < 100 \). Let's calculate the values of \( a \) and their sums with \( b \).

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The calculated values of \( a \) and their corresponding sums with \( b = 36 \) are:

- For \( k = 1 \): \( a = 3 \), sum = \( 39 \)
- For \( k = 5 \): \( a = 15 \), sum = \( 51 \)
- For \( k = 7 \): \( a = 21 \), sum = \( 57 \)
- For \( k = 11 \): \( a = 33 \), sum = \( 69 \)
- For \( k = 13 \): \( a = 39 \), sum = \( 75 \)
- For \( k = 17 \): \( a = 51 \), sum = \( 87 \)
- For \( k = 19 \): \( a = 57 \), sum = \( 93 \)
- For \( k = 23 \): \( a = 69 \), sum = \( 105 \) (not valid since \( a < 100 \))
- For \( k = 25 \): \( a = 75 \), sum = \( 111 \) (not valid since \( a < 100 \))
- For \( k = 29 \): \( a = 87 \), sum = \( 123 \) (not valid since \( a < 100 \))
- For \( k = 31 \): \( a = 93 \), sum = \( 129 \) (not valid since \( a < 100 \))

The valid sums are:

- \( 39, 51, 57, 69, 75, 87, 93 \)

The largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \) is \( 93 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{93}$. I hope it is correct.
