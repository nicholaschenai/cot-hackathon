What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the minimum value of the expression \(2x^2 + 3y^2 + 8x - 24y + 62\), we can complete the square for both the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

First, let's focus on the \(x\) terms: \(2x^2 + 8x\).

1. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\):
   \[
   2(x^2 + 4x)
   \]

2. Complete the square:
   - Take half of the coefficient of \(x\) (which is 4), square it, and add/subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   2\left(x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4\right) = 2\left((x + 2)^2 - 4\right) = 2(x + 2)^2 - 8
   \]

Now, let's rewrite the expression with the completed square for \(x\):
\[
2(x + 2)^2 - 8 + 3y^2 - 24y + 62
\]

Next, we will focus on the \(y\) terms: \(3y^2 - 24y\).

1. Factor out the coefficient of \(y^2\):
   \[
   3(y^2 - 8y)
   \]

2. Complete the square:
   - Take half of the coefficient of \(y\) (which is -8), square it, and add/subtract it inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3\left(y^2 - 8y + 16 - 16\right) = 3\left((y - 4)^2 - 16\right) = 3(y - 4)^2 - 48
   \]

Now, we can rewrite the entire expression:
\[
2(x + 2)^2 - 8 + 3(y - 4)^2 - 48 + 62
\]

Combining the constant terms:
\[
2(x + 2)^2 + 3(y - 4)^2 + 6
\]

Now, we can see that the expression is minimized when both squares are zero:
- \(2(x + 2)^2 = 0\) when \(x + 2 = 0\) or \(x = -2\)
- \(3(y - 4)^2 = 0\) when \(y - 4 = 0\) or \(y = 4\)

Substituting these values back into the expression gives us the minimum value:
\[
0 + 0 + 6 = 6
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\). I hope it is correct.
