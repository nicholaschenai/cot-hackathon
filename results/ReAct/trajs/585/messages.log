For what value of the constant $a$ does the system of equations below have infinitely many solutions?  \begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\ 6x &= 16 + a - 15y \end{align*}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the value of the constant \( a \) for which the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, we need to analyze the two equations:

1. \( 2x + 5y = -8 \)
2. \( 6x = 16 + a - 15y \)

For the system to have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must represent the same line. This means that one equation can be transformed into the other by multiplying or rearranging.

First, let's rewrite the second equation in a more standard form. We can rearrange it to match the form of the first equation. 

Starting with the second equation:

\[
6x = 16 + a - 15y
\]

We can rearrange it to:

\[
6x + 15y = 16 + a
\]

Now we have:

1. \( 2x + 5y = -8 \)
2. \( 6x + 15y = 16 + a \)

Next, we can express the first equation in a form that allows us to compare it with the second equation. We can multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
3(2x + 5y) = 3(-8)
\]

This gives us:

\[
6x + 15y = -24
\]

Now we have:

1. \( 6x + 15y = -24 \)
2. \( 6x + 15y = 16 + a \)

For these two equations to represent the same line, their right-hand sides must be equal:

\[
-24 = 16 + a
\]

Now, we can solve for \( a \). 

Let's do that step now.

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:


a = symbols('a')
equation = Eq(-24, 16 + a)
solution = solve(equation, a)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After solving the equation \(-24 = 16 + a\), we find:

\[
a = -24 - 16 = -40
\]

Thus, the value of the constant \( a \) for which the system of equations has infinitely many solutions is \( -40 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{-40}\). I hope it is correct.
