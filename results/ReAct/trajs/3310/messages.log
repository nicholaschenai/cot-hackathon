Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

================================ Human Message =================================

Arnold must water his cactus plants every 9 days and he must feed them every 60 days. He watered and fed them last Tuesday. What day of the week will it be the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the next day Arnold will water and feed his cactus plants on the same day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two intervals: 9 days for watering and 60 days for feeding.

First, let's calculate the LCM of 9 and 60. 

The prime factorization of the numbers is:
- \(9 = 3^2\)
- \(60 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1\)

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorizations.

Now, let's calculate the LCM step by step.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_NXcmHACZkEv91szkH5VH9XgG)
 Call ID: call_NXcmHACZkEv91szkH5VH9XgG
  Args:
    code: import sympy as sp
lcm = sp.lcm(9, 60)
lcm
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

lcm = sp.lcm(9, 60)
lcm

Result: 180
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 60 is 180 days. This means Arnold will water and feed his cactus plants on the same day again in 180 days.

Next, we need to determine what day of the week it will be 180 days from last Tuesday. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the remainder when 180 is divided by 7 to see how many days beyond the last Tuesday it will be.

Let's calculate \(180 \mod 7\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_rPVFMA56MsXf0BietTTyQ0Ox)
 Call ID: call_rPVFMA56MsXf0BietTTyQ0Ox
  Args:
    code: remainder = 180 % 7
remainder
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
remainder = 180 % 7
remainder

Result: 5
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The remainder when 180 is divided by 7 is 5. This means that 180 days from last Tuesday will be 5 days later in the week.

Starting from Tuesday:
- Wednesday (1 day)
- Thursday (2 days)
- Friday (3 days)
- Saturday (4 days)
- Sunday (5 days)

Therefore, 180 days from last Tuesday will be a Sunday.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$. I hope it is correct.
