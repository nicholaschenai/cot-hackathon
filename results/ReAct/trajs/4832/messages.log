For real numbers $t$ where $\tan t$ and $\sec t$ are defined, the point
\[(x,y) = (\tan t, \sec t)\]is plotted.  All the plotted points lie on what kind of curve?

(A) Line
(B) Circle
(C) Parabola
(D) Ellipse
(E) Hyperbola

Enter the letter of the correct option.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To determine the type of curve formed by the points \((x,y) = (\tan t, \sec t)\), we can start by recalling the definitions of the tangent and secant functions in terms of sine and cosine:

\[
\tan t = \frac{\sin t}{\cos t}, \quad \sec t = \frac{1}{\cos t}
\]

From these definitions, we can express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\):

\[
x = \tan t = \frac{\sin t}{\cos t}, \quad y = \sec t = \frac{1}{\cos t}
\]

Next, we can manipulate these equations to find a relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). We can express \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\):

1. From \(y = \sec t\), we have:
   \[
   \cos t = \frac{1}{y}
   \]

2. Substituting \(\cos t\) into the equation for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \tan t = \frac{\sin t}{\cos t} = \sin t \cdot y
   \]

Now, we can use the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1\). We can express \(\sin t\) in terms of \(y\):

\[
\sin^2 t = 1 - \cos^2 t = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{y^2}
\]

Now substituting \(\sin t = xy\) into the Pythagorean identity:

\[
(xy)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^2 = 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2y^2 + \frac{1}{y^2} = 1
\]

Multiplying through by \(y^2\) to eliminate the fraction gives:

\[
x^2y^4 + 1 = y^2
\]

Rearranging this equation leads to:

\[
x^2y^4 - y^2 + 1 = 0
\]

This is a polynomial equation in \(y\). To analyze the type of curve, we can look for a standard form. 

Next, we can check if this represents a hyperbola. A hyperbola can be represented in the form:

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

To confirm the type of curve, we can analyze the derived equation further. 

Let's summarize our findings and check if we can identify the curve type. 

Now, I will execute the code to confirm the relationship derived from the equations.

Executing code:

Result: [-sqrt(2)*sqrt(-sqrt(1 - 4*x**2)/x**2 + x**(-2))/2, sqrt(2)*sqrt(-sqrt(1 - 4*x**2)/x**2 + x**(-2))/2, -sqrt(2)*sqrt(sqrt(1 - 4*x**2)/x**2 + x**(-2))/2, sqrt(2)*sqrt(sqrt(1 - 4*x**2)/x**2 + x**(-2))/2]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The results from the equation show that we have multiple expressions for \(y\) in terms of \(x\). The presence of square roots and the structure of the equation suggest that the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is not linear or circular, but rather indicative of a hyperbolic nature.

The derived equation \(x^2y^4 - y^2 + 1 = 0\) can be rearranged and analyzed further, but the key point is that it does not conform to the standard forms of lines, circles, parabolas, or ellipses. Instead, it suggests a hyperbola due to the nature of the solutions involving square roots and the structure of the equation.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{E}$. I hope it is correct.
