You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

The expression $x^2 + 18x - 63$ can be written in the form $(x - a)(x + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are both nonnegative real numbers. What is the value of $b$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To rewrite the expression \(x^2 + 18x - 63\) in the form \((x - a)(x + b)\), we first need to factor the quadratic expression. 

The standard form of a quadratic is \(ax^2 + bx + c\). Here, we have:
- \(a = 1\)
- \(b = 18\)
- \(c = -63\)

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation \(x^2 + 18x - 63 = 0\). The roots will help us express the quadratic in factored form.

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Let's calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) first. 

I will compute this value.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_WnqlpF9tgO6H9SOwBgZqZ2AY)
 Call ID: call_WnqlpF9tgO6H9SOwBgZqZ2AY
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, simplify; x = symbols('x'); a = 1; b = 18; c = -63; discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c; simplify(discriminant)

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

x = symbols('x')
a = 1
b = 18
c = -63
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
simplify(discriminant)

Result: 576
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) is \(576\). 

Now, we can use this value to find the roots of the quadratic using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Next, I will calculate the square root of \(576\) and then find the roots.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_sgZl7BPoKrAPaqzFu5c1sVoB)
 Call ID: call_sgZl7BPoKrAPaqzFu5c1sVoB
  Args:
    code: from sympy import sqrt; sqrt_value = sqrt(576); sqrt_value
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

sqrt_value = sqrt(576)
sqrt_value

Result: 24
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The square root of \(576\) is \(24\). 

Now, substituting this back into the quadratic formula, we have:
\[
x = \frac{-18 \pm 24}{2}
\]

Next, I will calculate the two possible values for \(x\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_lJwcSeQSPgfIi7DkKu1PD9ln)
 Call ID: call_lJwcSeQSPgfIi7DkKu1PD9ln
  Args:
    code: root1 = (-18 + 24) / 2; root2 = (-18 - 24) / 2; (root1, root2)
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
root1 = (-18 + 24) / 2
root2 = (-18 - 24) / 2
(root1, root2)

Result: (3.0, -21.0)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The two roots of the quadratic are \(3\) and \(-21\). 

Since we want to express the quadratic in the form \((x - a)(x + b)\), we can identify:
- \(a = 3\) (since we take the positive root)
- \(b = 21\) (since we need \(b\) to be nonnegative)

Thus, the value of \(b\) is \(21\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{21}\). I hope it is correct.
