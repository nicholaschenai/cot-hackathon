You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

The average American consumes 1483 pounds of candy in a lifetime. Assuming that 1 year $=$ 52 weeks and the average life-span is 75 years, how many pounds of candy per week does the average American consume? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find out how many pounds of candy the average American consumes per week, we first need to determine the total number of weeks in an average lifespan of 75 years.

1. **Calculate the total number of weeks in 75 years**:
   - Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply the number of years by the number of weeks per year.

Let's calculate that first.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_Mmhom2R5oEPcRuWXozVP3bKr)
 Call ID: call_Mmhom2R5oEPcRuWXozVP3bKr
  Args:
    code: 75 * 52
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
75 * 52

Result: 3900
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of weeks in 75 years is 3900 weeks.

2. **Next, we need to find the average pounds of candy consumed per week**. We can do this by dividing the total lifetime consumption of candy (1483 pounds) by the total number of weeks (3900 weeks).

Let's perform that calculation now.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_xofwRuCLhSeTP2QwOxm6pUX1)
 Call ID: call_xofwRuCLhSeTP2QwOxm6pUX1
  Args:
    code: 1483 / 3900
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
1483 / 3900

Result: 0.38025641025641027
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The average pounds of candy consumed per week is approximately 0.38025641025641027.

3. **Now, we need to round this value to the nearest hundredth**. 

Let's round the result to two decimal places.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_2GpWCToiAwOHDpQuwNlqXSR8)
 Call ID: call_2GpWCToiAwOHDpQuwNlqXSR8
  Args:
    code: round(1483 / 3900, 2)
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
round(1483 / 3900, 2)

Result: 0.38
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After rounding to the nearest hundredth, the average pounds of candy consumed per week is 0.38.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{0.38}$. I hope it is correct.
