You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

A fraction is equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}.$ Its denominator and numerator add up to $91.$ What is the difference between the denominator and numerator of this fraction?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by letting the numerator be \( x \) and the denominator be \( y \). 

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The fraction is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{8} \), which gives us the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{y} = \frac{5}{8}
   \]

2. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 91:
   \[
   x + y = 91
   \]

Now, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using the first equation. Rearranging gives us:
\[
x = \frac{5}{8}y
\]

Next, we can substitute this expression for \( x \) into the second equation. 

Let's do that now.

Executing code:

x, y = symbols('x y')
equation1 = Eq(x, (5/8)*y)
equation2 = Eq(x + y, 91)
solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))
solution

Result: {x: 35.0000000000000, y: 56.0000000000000}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After substituting \( x = \frac{5}{8}y \) into the equation \( x + y = 91 \), we found the solutions:

- \( x = 35 \) (numerator)
- \( y = 56 \) (denominator)

Now, we need to find the difference between the denominator and the numerator. This can be calculated as:

\[
y - x = 56 - 35
\]

Let's compute this difference.

Executing code:
difference = 56 - 35

Result: 21
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The difference between the denominator and the numerator is \( 21 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{21}\). I hope it is correct.
