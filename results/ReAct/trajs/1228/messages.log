Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation,

A state had three letters followed by three digits as the format for license plates. In order to increase the number of plates available, the state changed the format to four letters followed by two digits. What is the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the positive difference between the number of license plates available with the old format and the new format, we first need to calculate the total number of plates for each format.

1. **Old Format (3 letters followed by 3 digits)**:
   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
   - For each of the 3 letter positions, there are 26 choices.
   - For the 3 digit positions, there are 10 digits (0-9), and for each position, there are 10 choices.

   Therefore, the total number of plates in the old format can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total plates (old)} = 26^3 \times 10^3
   \]

2. **New Format (4 letters followed by 2 digits)**:
   - Again, there are 26 letters for each of the 4 letter positions.
   - For the 2 digit positions, there are still 10 digits, with 10 choices for each position.

   Therefore, the total number of plates in the new format can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total plates (new)} = 26^4 \times 10^2
   \]

Next, I will calculate both totals. Let's start with the old format.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_Ltf5XqsTYjxGKGDiau1VGhcF)
 Call ID: call_Ltf5XqsTYjxGKGDiau1VGhcF
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, simplify
old_format = 26**3 * 10**3
old_format
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

old_format = 26**3 * 10**3
old_format

Result: 17576000
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of plates available with the old format (3 letters followed by 3 digits) is 17,576,000.

Now, let's calculate the total number of plates for the new format (4 letters followed by 2 digits).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_sLjSPDq62W0GMUZRJHUhAj8l)
 Call ID: call_sLjSPDq62W0GMUZRJHUhAj8l
  Args:
    code: new_format = 26**4 * 10**2
new_format
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
new_format = 26**4 * 10**2
new_format

Result: 45697600
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of plates available with the new format (4 letters followed by 2 digits) is 45,697,600.

Now, to find the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the old format, we will subtract the old format total from the new format total. 

Let's calculate that difference.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_gQfXavi05bhJk7IKnl32mqCy)
 Call ID: call_gQfXavi05bhJk7IKnl32mqCy
  Args:
    code: difference = new_format - old_format
difference
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
difference = new_format - old_format
difference

Result: 28121600
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the old format is 28,121,600.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{28121600}$. I hope it is correct.
