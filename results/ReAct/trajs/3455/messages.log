You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Compute $\gcd(6^210^2,15^4)$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To compute \(\gcd(6^{210^2}, 15^4)\), we first need to express the numbers \(6^{210^2}\) and \(15^4\) in terms of their prime factors.

1. **Factor the bases:**
   - The prime factorization of \(6\) is \(2 \cdot 3\).
   - The prime factorization of \(15\) is \(3 \cdot 5\).

2. **Express the powers:**
   - Therefore, we can express \(6^{210^2}\) as:
     \[
     6^{210^2} = (2 \cdot 3)^{210^2} = 2^{210^2} \cdot 3^{210^2}
     \]
   - And for \(15^4\):
     \[
     15^4 = (3 \cdot 5)^4 = 3^4 \cdot 5^4
     \]

3. **Now we have:**
   - \(6^{210^2} = 2^{210^2} \cdot 3^{210^2}\)
   - \(15^4 = 3^4 \cdot 5^4\)

Next, we will find the \(\gcd\) by taking the minimum power of each prime factor present in both expressions. 

The prime factors involved are \(2\), \(3\), and \(5\).

4. **Identify the powers:**
   - For \(2\): 
     - In \(6^{210^2}\), the power is \(210^2\).
     - In \(15^4\), the power is \(0\) (since \(15^4\) has no factor of \(2\)).
   - For \(3\):
     - In \(6^{210^2}\), the power is \(210^2\).
     - In \(15^4\), the power is \(4\).
   - For \(5\):
     - In \(6^{210^2}\), the power is \(0\) (since \(6^{210^2}\) has no factor of \(5\)).
     - In \(15^4\), the power is \(4\).

5. **Calculate the \(\gcd\):**
   - For \(2\): \(\min(210^2, 0) = 0\)
   - For \(3\): \(\min(210^2, 4) = 4\)
   - For \(5\): \(\min(0, 4) = 0\)

Thus, we can express the \(\gcd\) as:
\[
\gcd(6^{210^2}, 15^4) = 2^0 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^0 = 3^4
\]

Now, we will compute \(3^4\).
