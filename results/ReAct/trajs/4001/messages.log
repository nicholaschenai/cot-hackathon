## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Ten more than five times a number equals five more than ten times the number. What is the number?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let's denote the unknown number as \( x \).

From the problem statement, we can set up the equation based on the description:

1. "Five times a number" can be expressed as \( 5x \).
2. "Ten more than five times a number" translates to \( 5x + 10 \).
3. "Ten times the number" is \( 10x \).
4. "Five more than ten times the number" can be expressed as \( 10x + 5 \).

Now we can set up the equation:

\[
5x + 10 = 10x + 5
\]

Next, I will simplify this equation to isolate \( x \). 

Let's move all terms involving \( x \) to one side and constant terms to the other side. 

I'll execute the necessary steps to simplify the equation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After setting up the equation \( 5x + 10 = 10x + 5 \) and simplifying it, I found the solution for \( x \).

Now, let's interpret the result. The solution gives us the value of the unknown number. 

I'll check the value of \( x \) from the solution.
