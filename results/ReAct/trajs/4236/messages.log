Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

What is the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors, we need to consider the properties of perfect squares and prime factors.

1. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.
2. For a number to be a perfect square, all the prime factors in its prime factorization must have even exponents.

Given that we want 3 different prime factors, the smallest perfect square that meets this criterion will be the square of the product of the first three prime numbers.

The first three prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. 

Next, we will calculate the product of these primes and then square the result. 

Let's calculate this step by step. 

First, I will find the product of the first three prime numbers.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_QCFQNJN08NdcTVoMiuXG2rpX)
 Call ID: call_QCFQNJN08NdcTVoMiuXG2rpX
  Args:
    code: from sympy import prod, prime; primes = [prime(i) for i in range(1, 4)]; product = prod(primes)
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

primes = [prime(i) for i in range(1, 4)]
product = prod(primes)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The product of the first three prime numbers (2, 3, and 5) has been calculated. 

Now, I will square this product to find the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_Tmir03IHglg4Ggoj6PsDMJDS)
 Call ID: call_Tmir03IHglg4Ggoj6PsDMJDS
  Args:
    code: product**2
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Error: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'function' and 'int'
================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems there was an issue with the calculation. I will first explicitly calculate the product of the primes and then square that value. 

Let's do that step now.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_wHU0YbhnBk09rK9jsS6072Gf)
 Call ID: call_wHU0YbhnBk09rK9jsS6072Gf
  Args:
    code: from sympy import prime; p1 = prime(1); p2 = prime(2); p3 = prime(3); product = p1 * p2 * p3; perfect_square = product**2
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

p1 = prime(1)
p2 = prime(2)
p3 = prime(3)
product = p1 * p2 * p3
perfect_square = product**2

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I have calculated the product of the first three prime numbers and squared it to find the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors.

Now, I will retrieve the value of this perfect square.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_rdUsr5IS9z32VRVObDOqLWq0)
 Call ID: call_rdUsr5IS9z32VRVObDOqLWq0
  Args:
    code: perfect_square
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
perfect_square

Result: 900
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The least perfect square with 3 different prime factors is 900.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{900}$. I hope it is correct.
