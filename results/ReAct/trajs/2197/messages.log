Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that the binomial coefficient $\binom{10^9}{k}$ is less than the binomial coefficient $\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}$.  Let $a$ be the first (from the left) digit of $k$ and let $b$ be the second (from the left) digit of $k$.  What is the value of $10a + b$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the condition given:

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1}
\]

Using the identity for binomial coefficients, we can rewrite the right-hand side:

\[
\binom{10^9 + 1}{k - 1} = \binom{10^9}{k - 1} + \binom{10^9}{k}
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9}{k - 1} + \binom{10^9}{k}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{10^9}{k} < \binom{10^9}{k - 1}
\]

This means that:

\[
\frac{\binom{10^9}{k}}{\binom{10^9}{k - 1}} < 1
\]

Using the property of binomial coefficients, we can express this as:

\[
\frac{10^9 - k + 1}{k} < 1
\]

This leads to the inequality:

\[
10^9 - k + 1 < k
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
10^9 + 1 < 2k
\]

Thus, we can solve for \( k \):

\[
k > \frac{10^9 + 1}{2}
\]

Calculating this value:

\[
\frac{10^9 + 1}{2} = 500000000.5
\]

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we take the smallest integer greater than \( 500000000.5 \), which is:

\[
k = 500000001
\]

Next, we need to find the first and second digits of \( k \). The number \( 500000001 \) has:

- First digit \( a = 5 \)
- Second digit \( b = 0 \)

Now, we compute \( 10a + b \):

\[
10a + b = 10 \times 5 + 0 = 50
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{50}\). I hope it is correct.
