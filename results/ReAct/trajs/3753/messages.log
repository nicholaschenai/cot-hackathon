================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the perimeter of pentagon \(ABCDP\), we need to determine the lengths of all its sides: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DP\), and \(AP\).

1. **Identify the coordinates of points**:
   - Let \(A = (0, 0)\).
   - Since \(AP = 4\) and \(AP \perp BD\), point \(P\) is directly above \(A\) at \(P = (0, 4)\).
   - Since \(BP = 4\) and \(AB \perp BC\), point \(B\) is at \(B = (4, 4)\) (4 units to the right and 4 units up from \(A\)).
   - Since \(P\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BD}\), we can denote \(D\) as \(D = (4, y_D)\) and find \(y_D\) later.
   - Since \(BD \perp DC\), point \(C\) will be horizontally aligned with \(D\) and vertically aligned with \(B\).

2. **Calculate the coordinates of \(D\)**:
   - Since \(P\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{BD}\), we have:
     \[
     P = \left(\frac{4 + 4}{2}, \frac{4 + y_D}{2}\right) = (4, 0)
     \]
   - This gives us the equation:
     \[
     \frac{4 + y_D}{2} = 0 \implies 4 + y_D = 0 \implies y_D = -4
     \]
   - Thus, \(D = (4, -4)\).

3. **Determine the coordinates of \(C\)**:
   - Since \(C\) is horizontally aligned with \(D\) and vertically aligned with \(B\), we have \(C = (x_C, -4)\) where \(x_C\) is the x-coordinate of \(C\).
   - From the right triangle \(ABC\), we can find \(C\) using the distance \(BC\):
     - The distance \(BC\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     BC = \sqrt{(x_C - 4)^2 + (-4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_C - 4)^2 + (-8)^2}
     \]
   - We need to find \(x_C\) such that \(BC\) is a right angle with \(AB\).

4. **Calculate the lengths of the sides**:
   - \(AP = 4\)
   - \(BP = 4\)
   - \(AB = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\)
   - \(CD = |y_C - y_D| = |-4 - (-4)| = 0\) (since \(C\) and \(D\) are at the same y-coordinate).
   - \(DP = |y_D - y_P| = |-4 - 0| = 4\).

5. **Sum the lengths to find the perimeter**:
   - The perimeter \(P\) of pentagon \(ABCDP\) is:
   \[
   P = AB + BC + CD + DP + AP
   \]
   - We already have \(AP = 4\), \(BP = 4\), \(AB = 4\sqrt{2}\), \(CD = 0\), and \(DP = 4\).

Now, we can calculate the total perimeter:

\[
P = 4\sqrt{2} + 4 + 4 = 4\sqrt{2} + 8
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{4\sqrt{2} + 8}\). I hope it is correct.
