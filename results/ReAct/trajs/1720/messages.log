To find the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles, we first need to understand the dimensions of the original rectangle. 

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
P = 2(l + w)
\]

where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width. Given that the perimeter is 176, we can set up the equation:

\[
2(l + w) = 176
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

\[
l + w = 88
\]

Next, we need to determine how the original rectangle is divided into five congruent rectangles. The diagram suggests that the original rectangle is divided horizontally into two parts and vertically into three parts, resulting in five smaller rectangles.

Let's denote the width of the original rectangle as \( w \) and the length as \( l \). The five congruent rectangles will have the same width \( w \) and a height of \( \frac{l}{5} \).

Now, we can express the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles. The perimeter \( P_r \) of one of the smaller rectangles is given by:

\[
P_r = 2\left(\text{width} + \text{height}\right) = 2\left(w + \frac{l}{5}\right)
\]

Next, we will substitute \( l \) in terms of \( w \) using the equation \( l + w = 88 \). Thus, we can express \( l \) as:

\[
l = 88 - w
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( l \) into the perimeter formula for one of the smaller rectangles. 

Let's perform this substitution and simplify.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After substituting \( l = 88 - w \) into the perimeter formula for one of the smaller rectangles, we found that:

\[
P_r = \frac{8w}{5} + \frac{176}{5}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( w \) to calculate the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles. 

Since we know that the original rectangle is divided into five congruent rectangles, we can also analyze the dimensions. The total width \( w \) remains the same, while the length \( l \) is divided into five equal parts. 

To find \( w \), we can express the total length \( l \) in terms of the number of rectangles. Since the rectangles are congruent, we can assume that the width of each smaller rectangle is \( \frac{w}{5} \) and the height is \( l \).

However, we can also use the relationship \( l + w = 88 \) to find a specific value for \( w \). 

To find a suitable value for \( w \), we can consider that the total perimeter is fixed at 176. Let's express \( w \) in terms of \( l \) and substitute it back into the perimeter equation. 

We can also try some reasonable values for \( w \) to see if they yield integer dimensions for the smaller rectangles. 

Let's calculate the perimeter for a specific value of \( w \) that satisfies \( l + w = 88 \). 

For example, if we let \( w = 48 \), then \( l = 88 - 48 = 40 \). 

Now, let's calculate the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles using this value of \( w \).

================================== Ai Message ==================================

By substituting \( w = 48 \) into the perimeter formula for one of the smaller rectangles, we found that:

\[
P_r = 112
\]

Thus, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is 112.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{112}\). I hope it is correct.
