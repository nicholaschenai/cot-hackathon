## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What number is $5\%$ of $10\%$ of 1200?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find \(5\%\) of \(10\%\) of \(1200\), we can break this down into two steps:

1. First, calculate \(10\%\) of \(1200\).
2. Then, calculate \(5\%\) of the result from step 1.

Let's start with the first step: calculating \(10\%\) of \(1200\).

Thinking about it, \(10\%\) can be expressed as \(0.10\). So, we will multiply \(1200\) by \(0.10\).

Now, I will execute the calculation for \(10\%\) of \(1200\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_TMXViDxMeiYZQaiBcOeKIgOt)
 Call ID: call_TMXViDxMeiYZQaiBcOeKIgOt
  Args:
    code: 1200 * 0.10
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
1200 * 0.10

Result: 120.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The result of \(10\%\) of \(1200\) is \(120\).

Now, for the second step, we need to calculate \(5\%\) of \(120\). 

Again, \(5\%\) can be expressed as \(0.05\). So, we will multiply \(120\) by \(0.05\).

I will now execute the calculation for \(5\%\) of \(120\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_0xweEyzRHdmFqzHAhe6m6nXe)
 Call ID: call_0xweEyzRHdmFqzHAhe6m6nXe
  Args:
    code: 120 * 0.05
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
120 * 0.05

Result: 6.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The result of \(5\%\) of \(120\) is \(6\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\). I hope it is correct.
