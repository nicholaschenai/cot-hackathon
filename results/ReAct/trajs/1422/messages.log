You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the probability that the product of the integers picked by Krishanu and Shaunak is more than 10, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of outcomes**: Since both Krishanu and Shaunak can pick any integer from 1 to 10, the total number of outcomes is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

2. **Identify the successful outcomes**: We need to count the pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(x \cdot y > 10\), where \(x\) is the number picked by Krishanu and \(y\) is the number picked by Shaunak.

3. **Calculate the unsuccessful outcomes**: It might be easier to first count the pairs where \(x \cdot y \leq 10\) and then subtract this from the total outcomes.

Let's start by calculating the pairs where \(x \cdot y \leq 10\). 

We will iterate through all possible values of \(x\) (from 1 to 10) and for each \(x\), determine the possible values of \(y\) such that \(x \cdot y \leq 10\). 

I'll calculate the number of unsuccessful outcomes now.

            count += 1
count

Executing code:

x, y = symbols('x y')
count = 0
for x in range(1, 11):
    for y in range(1, 11):
        if x * y <= 10:
            count += 1
count

Result: 27
================================== Ai Message ==================================

We found that there are 27 pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(x \cdot y \leq 10\).

4. **Calculate the successful outcomes**: To find the number of successful outcomes where \(x \cdot y > 10\), we subtract the unsuccessful outcomes from the total outcomes:

\[
\text{Successful outcomes} = \text{Total outcomes} - \text{Unsuccessful outcomes} = 100 - 27 = 73
\]

5. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10 is given by the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:

\[
P(x \cdot y > 10) = \frac{\text{Successful outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{73}{100}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{73}{100}}\). I hope it is correct.
