## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Simplify $\sqrt{64^3}$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To simplify \(\sqrt{64^3}\), I will first rewrite the expression in a more manageable form. 

The square root can be expressed as an exponent: 

\[
\sqrt{64^3} = (64^3)^{1/2} = 64^{3/2}
\]

Next, I will simplify \(64^{3/2}\). Since \(64\) can be expressed as \(8^2\) or \(4^3\), I will use the fact that \(64 = 8^2\) to rewrite the expression. 

Now, let's calculate \(64^{3/2}\) using the exponent rules. 

I'll execute the calculation now.

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

result = (64**(3/2))
result

Result: 512.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After calculating, I found that:

\[
64^{3/2} = 512
\]

Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
\sqrt{64^3} = 512
\]

Thus, the final answer is: \(\boxed{512}\). I hope it is correct.
