You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

The sum of three consecutive even integers is $66$. What is the smallest of the three integers?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we first need to define the three consecutive even integers. Let's denote the smallest even integer as \( x \). The next two consecutive even integers can then be expressed as \( x + 2 \) and \( x + 4 \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. The sum of these three integers is equal to 66. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 66
\]

Next, I will simplify this equation.

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

x = symbols('x')
equation = Eq(x + (x + 2) + (x + 4), 66)
simplified_equation = equation.simplify()
simplified_equation

Result: Eq(x, 20)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After simplifying the equation, we find that:

\[
3x + 6 = 66
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 20
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), which represents the smallest of the three consecutive even integers, we can conclude that the smallest integer is 20. 

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.
