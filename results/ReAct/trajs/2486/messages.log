A certain ellipse is defined by
\[PF_1 + PF_2 = d.\]The equation of the ellipse is $4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y - 8 = 0.$  Find $d.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the value of \( d \) for the given ellipse, we first need to rewrite the equation of the ellipse in standard form. The given equation is:

\[
4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y - 8 = 0.
\]

Let's rearrange this equation to isolate the constant on one side. 

First, we can move \(-8\) to the right side:

\[
4x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 8.
\]

Next, we will complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms. 

Starting with the \( x \) terms:

1. The expression is \( 4x^2 - 8x \).
2. Factor out the 4: \( 4(x^2 - 2x) \).
3. To complete the square, take half of \(-2\) (which is \(-1\)), square it (getting \(1\)), and add/subtract it inside the parentheses:

\[
4(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) = 4((x - 1)^2 - 1) = 4(x - 1)^2 - 4.
\]

Now for the \( y \) terms:

1. The expression is \( y^2 + 4y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of \(4\) (which is \(2\)), square it (getting \(4\)), and add/subtract it:

\[
y^2 + 4y + 4 - 4 = (y + 2)^2 - 4.
\]

Now substituting these completed squares back into the equation gives:

\[
4((x - 1)^2 - 1) + ((y + 2)^2 - 4) = 8.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4(x - 1)^2 - 4 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 = 8.
\]

Combining the constants:

\[
4(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 - 8 = 8.
\]

Adding \(8\) to both sides:

\[
4(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 16.
\]

Dividing the entire equation by \(16\) gives:

\[
\frac{(x - 1)^2}{4} + \frac{(y + 2)^2}{16} = 1.
\]

Now we can identify the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The standard form of the ellipse is:

\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1,
\]

where \( a^2 = 4 \) and \( b^2 = 16 \). Thus, we have:

- \( a = 2 \) (semi-minor axis)
- \( b = 4 \) (semi-major axis)

The distance \( d \) is given by the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci, which is equal to \( 2b \):

\[
d = 2b = 2 \times 4 = 8.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{8}\). I hope it is correct.
