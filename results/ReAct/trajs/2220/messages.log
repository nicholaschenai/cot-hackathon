The sum of an infinite geometric series is a positive number $S$, and the second term in the series is $1$. What is the smallest possible value of $S?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve this problem, we need to recall the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. The sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) (where \( |r| < 1 \)) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

We know that the second term of the series is \( 1 \). The second term can be expressed in terms of the first term and the common ratio:

\[
\text{Second term} = ar = 1
\]

From this equation, we can express \( r \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
r = \frac{1}{a}
\]

Now, substituting \( r \) back into the sum formula, we have:

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - \frac{1}{a}} = \frac{a}{\frac{a - 1}{a}} = \frac{a^2}{a - 1}
\]

Next, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( S \) given that \( S \) is a positive number. To do this, we will analyze the function \( S(a) = \frac{a^2}{a - 1} \) for \( a > 1 \) (since \( a \) must be positive and \( r < 1 \) implies \( a > 1 \)).

Let's find the derivative of \( S(a) \) to locate any critical points. 

First, we will compute the derivative \( S'(a) \).

a = sp.symbols('a')
S = a**2 / (a - 1)
S_prime = sp.diff(S, a)
S_prime

Result: -a**2/(a - 1)**2 + 2*a/(a - 1)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The derivative of \( S(a) \) is:

\[
S'(a) = -\frac{a^2}{(a - 1)^2} + \frac{2a}{a - 1}
\]

To find the critical points, we need to set \( S'(a) = 0 \):

\[
-\frac{a^2}{(a - 1)^2} + \frac{2a}{a - 1} = 0
\]

Next, we will simplify this equation to find the values of \( a \). Let's multiply through by \( (a - 1)^2 \) to eliminate the denominator.

Result: [0, 2]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The critical points we found are \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 2 \). Since \( a \) must be greater than 1 for the series to converge, we will only consider \( a = 2 \).

Next, we will evaluate \( S \) at this critical point to find the minimum value of \( S \):

\[
S(2) = \frac{2^2}{2 - 1} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
\]

Now, we should also check the behavior of \( S(a) \) as \( a \) approaches 1 from the right (since \( a \) must be greater than 1). Let's evaluate the limit:

\[
\lim_{a \to 1^+} S(a)
\]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The limit of \( S(a) \) as \( a \) approaches 1 from the right is:

\[
\lim_{a \to 1^+} S(a) = \infty
\]

This indicates that \( S(a) \) increases without bound as \( a \) approaches 1. 

Thus, the minimum value of \( S \) occurs at \( a = 2 \), which we calculated to be:

\[
S(2) = 4
\]

Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

I hope it is correct.
