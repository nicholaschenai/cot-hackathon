Given 5 colors to choose from, how many ways can we color the four unit squares of a $2\times 2$ board, given that two colorings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other? (Note that we can use the same color for more than one square.)

To solve the problem of coloring the four unit squares of a \(2 \times 2\) board with 5 colors, considering rotations as identical, we can use Burnside's lemma. This lemma helps us count the distinct arrangements by considering the symmetries of the object.

First, we need to identify the symmetries of the \(2 \times 2\) board. The symmetries include:

1. **Identity rotation (0 degrees)**: All squares remain in their original position.
2. **90-degree rotation**: The squares rotate clockwise.
3. **180-degree rotation**: The squares swap positions diagonally.
4. **270-degree rotation**: The squares rotate counterclockwise.

Next, we will calculate the number of colorings fixed by each of these rotations.

1. **Identity rotation (0 degrees)**: Every coloring remains unchanged. Since we have 5 colors and 4 squares, the total number of colorings is:
   \[
   5^4
   \]

2. **90-degree rotation**: For a coloring to remain unchanged, all four squares must be the same color. Thus, there are:
   \[
   5
   \]
   fixed colorings (one for each color).

3. **180-degree rotation**: The squares at opposite corners must be the same color. We can choose a color for the two pairs of opposite squares independently. Therefore, the number of fixed colorings is:
   \[
   5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

4. **270-degree rotation**: Similar to the 90-degree rotation, all squares must be the same color. Thus, there are:
   \[
   5
   \]
   fixed colorings.

Now, we can summarize the number of fixed colorings for each symmetry:

- Identity: \(5^4\)
- 90-degree: \(5\)
- 180-degree: \(25\)
- 270-degree: \(5\)

Next, we will apply Burnside's lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by these symmetries. We will calculate this average:

\[
\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \frac{1}{4} \left( 5^4 + 5 + 25 + 5 \right)
\]

Now, let's compute \(5^4\) and then the total sum.

Result: 625
================================== Ai Message ==================================

We found that \(5^4 = 625\). Now, we can sum up the contributions from all the symmetries:

\[
625 + 5 + 25 + 5 = 660
\]

Next, we will calculate the average by dividing this sum by the number of symmetries, which is 4:

\[
\text{Number of distinct colorings} = \frac{660}{4}
\]

Now, let's compute this division.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_QaAx1cmbKo5ptN4TnanueDrE)

  Args:
    code: 660 / 4
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
660 / 4

Result: 165.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The calculation gives us \( \frac{660}{4} = 165 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{165}\). I hope it is correct.
