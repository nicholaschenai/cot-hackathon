A rectangular box has volume 216.  Find the smallest possible surface area of the box.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the smallest possible surface area of a rectangular box with a given volume, we can use the following steps:

1. **Define the variables**: Let the dimensions of the box be \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). The volume \( V \) of the box is given by the equation:
   \[
   V = x \cdot y \cdot z = 216
   \]

2. **Surface area formula**: The surface area \( S \) of the box is given by:
   \[
   S = 2(xy + xz + yz)
   \]

3. **Express one variable in terms of the others**: From the volume equation, we can express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
   \[
   z = \frac{216}{xy}
   \]

4. **Substitute \( z \) into the surface area formula**: We can substitute this expression for \( z \) into the surface area formula to express \( S \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \) only.

Let's perform this substitution and simplify the surface area expression.

 Call ID: call_Mmhom2R5oEPcRuWXozVP3bKr
  Args:
    code: from sympy import symbols, simplify
x, y = symbols('x y')
z = 216 / (x * y)
S = 2 * (x * y + x * z + y * z)
S_substituted = simplify(S.subs(z, 216 / (x * y)))
S_substituted

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

x, y = symbols('x y')
z = 216 / (x * y)
S = 2 * (x * y + x * z + y * z)
S_substituted = simplify(S.subs(z, 216 / (x * y)))
S_substituted

Result: 2*x*y + 432/y + 432/x
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After substituting \( z \) into the surface area formula, we have the surface area expressed as:

\[
S = 2xy + \frac{432}{y} + \frac{432}{x}
\]

Next, we need to minimize this surface area \( S \) with respect to the variables \( x \) and \( y \). To do this, we can use the method of partial derivatives. 

5. **Take partial derivatives**: We will take the partial derivatives of \( S \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), set them to zero, and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's calculate the partial derivatives of \( S \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).

  sympy_execute (call_6xGsqNW6Q4Oe9F2QSy3EefqN)
 Call ID: call_6xGsqNW6Q4Oe9F2QSy3EefqN
  Args:
    code: from sympy import diff, Eq, solve
S = 2*x*y + 432/y + 432/x
partial_x = diff(S, x)
partial_y = diff(S, y)
partial_x, partial_y
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

S = 2*x*y + 432/y + 432/x
partial_x = diff(S, x)
partial_y = diff(S, y)
partial_x, partial_y

Result: (2*y - 432/x**2, 2*x - 432/y**2)
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The partial derivatives of the surface area \( S \) are:

\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial x} = 2y - \frac{432}{x^2}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial y} = 2x - \frac{432}{y^2}
\]

Next, we will set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:

6. **Set the partial derivatives to zero**:
   \[
   2y - \frac{432}{x^2} = 0
   \]
   \[
   2x - \frac{432}{y^2} = 0
   \]

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously for \( x \) and \( y \).

  sympy_execute (call_sPucvj7kHNQnQmSPW4neCmSQ)
 Call ID: call_sPucvj7kHNQnQmSPW4neCmSQ
  Args:
    code: eq1 = Eq(2*y, 432/x**2)
eq2 = Eq(2*x, 432/y**2)
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
solution
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
eq1 = Eq(2*y, 432/x**2)
eq2 = Eq(2*x, 432/y**2)
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
solution

Result: [(6, 6), (-3 - 3*sqrt(3)*I, -3 - 3*sqrt(3)*I), (-3 + 3*sqrt(3)*I, -3 + 3*sqrt(3)*I)]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The solutions to the equations are:

1. \( (x, y) = (6, 6) \)
2. Two complex solutions, which we can disregard since dimensions must be positive.

Now that we have \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 6 \), we can find \( z \) using the volume equation:

7. **Calculate \( z \)**:
   \[
   z = \frac{216}{xy} = \frac{216}{6 \cdot 6}
   \]

Let's calculate \( z \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_CytOJmVwQWckCzoWEY2EX4jN)
 Call ID: call_CytOJmVwQWckCzoWEY2EX4jN
  Args:
    code: z = 216 / (6 * 6)
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
z = 216 / (6 * 6)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Calculating \( z \) gives us:

\[
z = \frac{216}{36} = 6
\]

Thus, the dimensions of the box are \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 \), and \( z = 6 \).

8. **Calculate the surface area**: Now we can find the surface area using these dimensions:

\[
S = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 2(6 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 6)
\]

Let's calculate the surface area \( S \).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_9ZWa1d2YdlT83oOW1Zjqh3Ao)
 Call ID: call_9ZWa1d2YdlT83oOW1Zjqh3Ao
  Args:
    code: S = 2 * (6 * 6 + 6 * 6 + 6 * 6)
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
S = 2 * (6 * 6 + 6 * 6 + 6 * 6)

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Calculating the surface area \( S \) gives us:

\[
S = 2(36 + 36 + 36) = 2(108) = 216
\]

Therefore, the smallest possible surface area of the box is:

\[
\boxed{216}
\]

I hope it is correct.
