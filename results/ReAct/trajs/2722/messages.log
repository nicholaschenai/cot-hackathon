Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exists $r \in (0, \tfrac{1}{1000})$ such that the number $(n+r)^3$ is an integer.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exists \( r \in (0, \tfrac{1}{1000}) \) such that \( (n+r)^3 \) is an integer, we start by expressing \( (n+r)^3 \) in a more manageable form.

We can expand \( (n+r)^3 \) using the binomial theorem:

\[
(n+r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3
\]

For \( (n+r)^3 \) to be an integer, the term \( 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3 \) must also be an integer. Since \( r \) is a small positive number, we can analyze the conditions under which this expression is an integer.

The term \( r \) must be such that \( 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3 \) is an integer. Since \( r \) is in the interval \( (0, \tfrac{1}{1000}) \), we can denote \( r = \frac{k}{1000} \) for some integer \( k \) where \( 0 < k < 1000 \).

Substituting \( r \) into the expression gives:

\[
3n^2 \left(\frac{k}{1000}\right) + 3n \left(\frac{k}{1000}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{k}{1000}\right)^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3n^2k}{1000} + \frac{3nk^2}{1000000} + \frac{k^3}{1000000000}
\]

For this entire expression to be an integer, the term \( 3n^2k \) must be divisible by \( 1000 \). This leads us to the condition:

\[
3n^2k \equiv 0 \mod 1000
\]

Since \( 3 \) and \( 1000 \) are coprime, \( n^2k \) must be divisible by \( \frac{1000}{3} = 333.33\ldots \). Thus, \( n^2k \) must be divisible by \( 1000 \).

Next, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exists a \( k \) satisfying this condition. 

To ensure \( n^2 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \), we can factor \( 1000 \):

\[
1000 = 2^3 \cdot 5^3
\]

Thus, \( n^2 \) must be at least \( 1000 \), which means \( n \) must be at least \( \sqrt{1000} \). The smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this is \( n = 32 \) since \( 32^2 = 1024 \) which is greater than \( 1000 \).

Now, we need to check if \( n = 32 \) allows for a suitable \( k \):

\[
n^2 = 32^2 = 1024
\]

We can choose \( k = 1 \) (the smallest positive integer) to check if \( 3n^2k \) is divisible by \( 1000 \):

\[
3 \cdot 1024 \cdot 1 = 3072
\]

Now we check if \( 3072 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \):

\[
3072 \mod 1000 = 72 \quad (\text{not divisible})
\]

Next, we try \( n = 40 \):

\[
n^2 = 40^2 = 1600
\]

Choosing \( k = 1 \):

\[
3 \cdot 1600 \cdot 1 = 4800
\]

Now we check if \( 4800 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \):

\[
4800 \mod 1000 = 800 \quad (\text{not divisible})
\]

Continuing this process, we find that \( n = 50 \):

\[
n^2 = 50^2 = 2500
\]

Choosing \( k = 1 \):

\[
3 \cdot 2500 \cdot 1 = 7500
\]

Now we check if \( 7500 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \):

\[
7500 \mod 1000 = 500 \quad (\text{not divisible})
\]

Continuing this process, we find that \( n = 100 \):

\[
n^2 = 100^2 = 10000
\]

Choosing \( k = 1 \):

\[
3 \cdot 10000 \cdot 1 = 30000
\]

Now we check if \( 30000 \) is divisible by \( 1000 \):

\[
30000 \mod 1000 = 0 \quad (\text{divisible})
\]

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the condition is \( n = 100 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{100}\). I hope it is correct.
