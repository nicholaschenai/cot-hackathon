A cubic block of wood with side lengths of 10 cm is cut into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 cm. What is the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood? Express your answer as a common fraction.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks, we first need to calculate the surface area of both the larger block and the smaller blocks.

1. **Calculate the surface area of the larger block:**
   The larger block is a cube with a side length of 10 cm. The formula for the surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
   \[
   A = 6s^2
   \]
   For the larger block:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = 6 \times (10 \, \text{cm})^2
   \]

Now, let's calculate this surface area.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_U1EKxAGg2oIsxdCVe2dAZqFD)
 Call ID: call_U1EKxAGg2oIsxdCVe2dAZqFD
  Args:
    code: from sympy import *
# Define the side length of the larger block
s_large = 10
# Calculate the surface area of the larger block
A_large = 6 * s_large**2
A_large
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

# Define the side length of the larger block
s_large = 10
# Calculate the surface area of the larger block
A_large = 6 * s_large**2
A_large

Result: 600
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The surface area of the larger block is \( 600 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

2. **Calculate the surface area of the smaller blocks:**
   The smaller blocks are cubes with a side length of 1 cm. Using the same formula for the surface area of a cube:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = 6 \times (1 \, \text{cm})^2
   \]

Now, let's calculate the surface area of one smaller block.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_jbCdPo9SMF0Wx7PFRCnTkCWw)
 Call ID: call_jbCdPo9SMF0Wx7PFRCnTkCWw
  Args:
    code: # Define the side length of the smaller block
s_small = 1
# Calculate the surface area of one smaller block
A_small = 6 * s_small**2
A_small
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
# Define the side length of the smaller block
s_small = 1
# Calculate the surface area of one smaller block
A_small = 6 * s_small**2
A_small

Result: 6
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The surface area of one smaller block is \( 6 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of smaller blocks:**
   The larger block has a volume of \( 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Each smaller block has a volume of \( 1 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Therefore, the total number of smaller blocks is:
   \[
   \text{Number of smaller blocks} = \frac{\text{Volume of larger block}}{\text{Volume of smaller block}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{cm}^3}{1 \, \text{cm}^3}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of smaller blocks.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_lJjGK7zLY510aTAl1p7puZXO)
 Call ID: call_lJjGK7zLY510aTAl1p7puZXO
  Args:
    code: # Calculate the volume of the larger block
volume_large = 10**3
# Calculate the volume of one smaller block
volume_small = 1**3
# Calculate the number of smaller blocks
num_smaller_blocks = volume_large / volume_small
num_smaller_blocks
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
# Calculate the volume of the larger block
volume_large = 10**3
# Calculate the volume of one smaller block
volume_small = 1**3
# Calculate the number of smaller blocks
num_smaller_blocks = volume_large / volume_small
num_smaller_blocks

Result: 1000.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of smaller blocks is \( 1000 \).

4. **Calculate the combined surface area of all smaller blocks:**
   The combined surface area of the smaller blocks is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{combined}} = \text{Number of smaller blocks} \times A_{\text{small}} = 1000 \times 6 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Now, let's calculate the combined surface area of the smaller blocks.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_NXoxkLCflC7LKqf0g1iWxEgr)
 Call ID: call_NXoxkLCflC7LKqf0g1iWxEgr
  Args:
    code: # Calculate the combined surface area of the smaller blocks
A_combined = num_smaller_blocks * A_small
A_combined
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
# Calculate the combined surface area of the smaller blocks
A_combined = num_smaller_blocks * A_small
A_combined

Result: 6000.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The combined surface area of the smaller blocks is \( 6000 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

5. **Calculate the ratio of the surface area of the larger block to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks:**
   The ratio is given by:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{A_{\text{large}}}{A_{\text{combined}}} = \frac{600 \, \text{cm}^2}{6000 \, \text{cm}^2}
   \]

Now, let's calculate this ratio.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_PDTfgMI8e5FKuZh2cCieQoKz)
 Call ID: call_PDTfgMI8e5FKuZh2cCieQoKz
  Args:
    code: # Calculate the ratio of the surface area of the larger block to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks
ratio = A_large / A_combined
ratio
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
# Calculate the ratio of the surface area of the larger block to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks
ratio = A_large / A_combined
ratio

Result: 0.1
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The ratio of the surface area of the larger block to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks is \( 0.1 \).

To express this as a common fraction, we can write it as:
\[
\frac{1}{10}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}\). I hope it is correct.
