You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Find the positive base $b$ in which the equation $4 \cdot 12 = 103$ is valid.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the equation \(4 \cdot 12 = 103\) in base \(b\), we first need to express each number in terms of base \(b\).

1. The number \(4\) in base \(b\) is simply \(4\).
2. The number \(12\) in base \(b\) can be expressed as \(1 \cdot b + 2\).
3. The number \(103\) in base \(b\) can be expressed as \(1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b + 3\).

Now, we can rewrite the equation \(4 \cdot 12 = 103\) in terms of \(b\):

\[
4 \cdot (1 \cdot b + 2) = 1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b + 3
\]

Next, we will simplify the left side of the equation. 

Let's calculate \(4 \cdot (1 \cdot b + 2)\).

    code: from sympy import symbols, expand
b = symbols('b')
left_side = 4 * (1 * b + 2)

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

b = symbols('b')
left_side = 4 * (1 * b + 2)
expand(left_side)

Result: 4*b + 8
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The left side simplifies to \(4b + 8\).

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
4b + 8 = b^2 + 3
\]

Next, we will rearrange this equation to set it to zero:

\[
b^2 - 4b + 3 - 8 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
b^2 - 4b - 5 = 0
\]

Now, we will solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
b = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
\]

where \(A = 1\), \(B = -4\), and \(C = -5\). Let's calculate the discriminant and then find the values of \(b\).

 Call ID: call_qhi177kRFk2c3pGK4sH1FvPH
  Args:
    code: from sympy import sqrt
A = 1
B = -4
C = -5
discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C
b_values = [(-B + sqrt(discriminant))/(2*A), (-B - sqrt(discriminant))/(2*A)]
discriminant, b_values
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

A = 1
B = -4
C = -5
discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C
b_values = [(-B + sqrt(discriminant))/(2*A), (-B - sqrt(discriminant))/(2*A)]
discriminant, b_values

Result: (36, [5, -1])
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The discriminant is \(36\), which is positive, indicating that there are two real solutions. The values of \(b\) are:

\[
b = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad b = -1
\]

Since we are looking for the positive base \(b\), we take \(b = 5\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\). I hope it is correct.
