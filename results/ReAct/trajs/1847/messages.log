[/asy] The area of the shaded region can be expressed in the form $a-b\pi$ square units, where $a$ and $b$ are both integers. What is the value of $a+b?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the area of the shaded region, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of the square.**
   The square has sides of length 6 units. The area \( A_{\text{square}} \) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared.

2. **Calculate the area of the quarter-circles.**
   Each quarter-circle has a radius of 3 units. The area \( A_{\text{quarter-circle}} \) of one quarter-circle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is \( \pi r^2 \), and then taking one-fourth of that area.

3. **Calculate the total area of the quarter-circles.**
   Since there are four quarter-circles, we will multiply the area of one quarter-circle by 4.

4. **Subtract the total area of the quarter-circles from the area of the square.**
   This will give us the area of the shaded region.

Let's start with the first step: calculating the area of the square. 

The area of the square is given by:
\[
A_{\text{square}} = \text{side}^2 = 6^2
\]

Now, I will execute this calculation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area of the square is \( A_{\text{square}} = 36 \) square units.

Next, let's move on to the second step: calculating the area of one quarter-circle. The radius of each quarter-circle is 3 units. The area of a full circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \), so the area of one quarter-circle is:

\[
A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi (3^2)
\]

Now, I will execute this calculation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area of one quarter-circle is approximately \( A_{\text{quarter-circle}} \approx 7.0686 \) square units.

Now, let's calculate the total area of the four quarter-circles:

\[
A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} = 4 \times A_{\text{quarter-circle}}
\]

I will execute this calculation next.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total area of the four quarter-circles is approximately \( A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} \approx 28.2743 \) square units.

Now, we can find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the total area of the quarter-circles from the area of the square:

\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{square}} - A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} = 36 - 28.27431
\]

I will execute this calculation to find the area of the shaded region.

Result: 7.72569
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area of the shaded region is approximately \( A_{\text{shaded}} \approx 7.7257 \) square units.

To express this area in the form \( a - b\pi \), we need to identify \( a \) and \( b \). 

From our calculations:
- The area of the square is \( 36 \).
- The area of the total quarter-circles is \( 28.27431 \), which can be expressed as \( 28.27431 \approx 9\pi \) (since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \)).

Thus, we can express the area of the shaded region as:

\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = 36 - 9\pi
\]

Here, \( a = 36 \) and \( b = 9 \).

Now, we can find \( a + b \):

\[
a + b = 36 + 9
\]

I will execute this final calculation.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{45}\). I hope it is correct.
