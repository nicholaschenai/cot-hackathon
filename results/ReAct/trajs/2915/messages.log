The number $$\sqrt{104\sqrt6+468\sqrt{10}+144\sqrt{15}+2006}$$can be written as $a\sqrt2+b\sqrt3+c\sqrt5$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers.  Find $a\cdot b\cdot c.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the expression inside the square root:

\[
\sqrt{104\sqrt{6} + 468\sqrt{10} + 144\sqrt{15} + 2006}
\]

We will first rewrite the terms involving square roots in a more manageable form. The terms can be expressed in terms of their prime factors:

- \( \sqrt{6} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} \)
- \( \sqrt{10} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{5} \)
- \( \sqrt{15} = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{5} \)

Now, let's express the entire expression in terms of \( \sqrt{2} \), \( \sqrt{3} \), and \( \sqrt{5} \):

1. \( 104\sqrt{6} = 104\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} \)
2. \( 468\sqrt{10} = 468\sqrt{2}\sqrt{5} \)
3. \( 144\sqrt{15} = 144\sqrt{3}\sqrt{5} \)

Next, we will group the terms accordingly. Let's denote:

- \( x = \sqrt{2} \)
- \( y = \sqrt{3} \)
- \( z = \sqrt{5} \)

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
104xy + 468xz + 144yz + 2006
\]

Next, we will try to express this as a perfect square. We will assume that the expression can be written in the form:

\[
(a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{5})^2
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
a^2 \cdot 2 + b^2 \cdot 3 + c^2 \cdot 5 + 2ab\sqrt{6} + 2ac\sqrt{10} + 2bc\sqrt{15}
\]

Now, we will match coefficients with the original expression:

1. The constant term: \( a^2 \cdot 2 + b^2 \cdot 3 + c^2 \cdot 5 = 2006 \)
2. The coefficient of \( \sqrt{6} \): \( 2ab = 104 \)
3. The coefficient of \( \sqrt{10} \): \( 2ac = 468 \)
4. The coefficient of \( \sqrt{15} \): \( 2bc = 144 \)

Now, we will solve these equations step by step. 

First, let's solve for \( ab \):

\[
ab = \frac{104}{2} = 52
\]

Next, let's solve for \( ac \):

\[
ac = \frac{468}{2} = 234
\]

And for \( bc \):

\[
bc = \frac{144}{2} = 72
\]

Now we have three equations:

1. \( ab = 52 \)
2. \( ac = 234 \)
3. \( bc = 72 \)

Next, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \) using the equations. From \( ab = 52 \), we can express \( b \) as:

\[
b = \frac{52}{a}
\]

Substituting \( b \) into \( bc = 72 \):

\[
\frac{52}{a}c = 72 \implies c = \frac{72a}{52} = \frac{18a}{13}
\]

Now substituting \( c \) into \( ac = 234 \):

\[
a \cdot \frac{18a}{13} = 234 \implies \frac{18a^2}{13} = 234 \implies 18a^2 = 234 \cdot 13
\]

Calculating \( 234 \cdot 13 \):

\[
234 \cdot 13 = 3042
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
18a^2 = 3042 \implies a^2 = \frac{3042}{18} = 169
\]

Taking the square root gives:

\[
a = 13
\]

Now substituting \( a = 13 \) back to find \( b \) and \( c \):

\[
b = \frac{52}{13} = 4
\]

And for \( c \):

\[
c = \frac{18 \cdot 13}{13} = 18
\]

Now we have \( a = 13 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = 18 \). 

Finally, we need to find \( a \cdot b \cdot c \):

\[
a \cdot b \cdot c = 13 \cdot 4 \cdot 18
\]

Calculating this:

\[
13 \cdot 4 = 52
\]
\[
52 \cdot 18 = 936
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{936}\). I hope it is correct.
