What is the least common multiple of 72 and 96?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and 96, we can start by determining the prime factorization of each number.

1. **Prime Factorization of 72**:
   - 72 can be divided by 2: \( 72 \div 2 = 36 \)
   - 36 can be divided by 2: \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \)
   - 18 can be divided by 2: \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
   - 9 can be divided by 3: \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
   - 3 can be divided by 3: \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

   So, the prime factorization of 72 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \).

2. **Prime Factorization of 96**:
   - 96 can be divided by 2: \( 96 \div 2 = 48 \)
   - 48 can be divided by 2: \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
   - 24 can be divided by 2: \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
   - 12 can be divided by 2: \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
   - 6 can be divided by 2: \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)
   - 3 can be divided by 3: \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

   So, the prime factorization of 96 is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \).

Next, we will use these factorizations to find the LCM. The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.

Now, let's identify the highest powers of the primes from both factorizations:
- For the prime \( 2 \): the highest power is \( 2^5 \) (from 96).
- For the prime \( 3 \): the highest power is \( 3^2 \) (from 72).

Now, we can express the LCM as:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^5 \times 3^2
\]

Next, I will calculate this expression.

After calculating the expression, we find that the least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and 96 is 288.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{288}$. I hope it is correct.
