The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is $13.$ The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed is $27.$ What is the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Let's denote the two-digit number as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. 

From the problem, we have two conditions:

1. The sum of the digits is \( a + b = 13 \).
2. The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed is \( (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27 \).

Let's simplify the second condition. 

The expression for the difference can be rewritten as:
\[
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 9a - 9b = 27
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
9(a - b) = 27
\]

Now, we can divide both sides by 9:
\[
a - b = 3
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( a + b = 13 \)
2. \( a - b = 3 \)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. Let's add the two equations together to eliminate \( b \). 

I'll execute the code to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Executing code:


a, b = symbols('a b')
equation1 = Eq(a + b, 13)
equation2 = Eq(a - b, 3)
solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (a, b))
solution

Result: {a: 8, b: 5}
================================== Ai Message ==================================

From the calculations, we found that \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 5 \). 

This means the original two-digit number is:
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 8 + 5 = 85
\]

Next, we need to find the number with its digits reversed, which is:
\[
10b + a = 10 \times 5 + 8 = 58
\]

Now, we can find the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed:
\[
85 + 58
\]

I'll execute the code to calculate this sum.

Result: 143
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The sum of the original number \( 85 \) and the number with its digits reversed \( 58 \) is:
\[
85 + 58 = 143
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{143}\). I hope it is correct.
