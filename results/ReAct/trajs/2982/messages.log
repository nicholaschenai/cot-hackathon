Define the function $f(x)=\frac{a}{1-x}$. If $f(-1)=f^{-1}(4a+1)$, find the product of all possible values of $a$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) = \frac{a}{1-x} \).

First, we need to find \( f(-1) \):
\[
f(-1) = \frac{a}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{a}{1 + 1} = \frac{a}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(y) \). To do this, we set \( y = f(x) \):
\[
y = \frac{a}{1-x}.
\]
Rearranging this equation to solve for \( x \):
\[
y(1-x) = a \implies y - yx = a \implies yx = y - a \implies x = \frac{y - a}{y}.
\]
Thus, the inverse function is:
\[
f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y - a}{y}.
\]

Now, we need to evaluate \( f^{-1}(4a + 1) \):
\[
f^{-1}(4a + 1) = \frac{(4a + 1) - a}{4a + 1} = \frac{3a + 1}{4a + 1}.
\]

According to the problem, we have the equation:
\[
f(-1) = f^{-1}(4a + 1).
\]
Substituting the expressions we found:
\[
\frac{a}{2} = \frac{3a + 1}{4a + 1}.
\]

Next, we will cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[
a(4a + 1) = 2(3a + 1).
\]
Expanding both sides:
\[
4a^2 + a = 6a + 2.
\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[
4a^2 + a - 6a - 2 = 0 \implies 4a^2 - 5a - 2 = 0.
\]

Now, we will use the quadratic formula to find the values of \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 4}.
\]
Calculating the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 25 + 32 = 57.
\]
Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:
\[
a = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{57}}{8}.
\]

The product of the roots of the quadratic equation \( 4a^2 - 5a - 2 = 0 \) can be found using the formula \( \frac{c}{a} \):
\[
\text{Product of roots} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}\). I hope it is correct.
