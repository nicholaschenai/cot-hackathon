You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

What is the sum of all integer values of $x$ such that $\frac{3}{x}$ is greater than $\frac{1}{3}$ and less than $\frac{3}{4}$?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the inequality \(\frac{3}{x} > \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{3}{x} < \frac{3}{4}\), we will break it down into two parts.

First, let's solve the inequality \(\frac{3}{x} > \frac{1}{3}\).

1. Rearranging the inequality gives us:
   \[
   3 > \frac{1}{3} x
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3 (and noting that \(x\) must be positive to maintain the direction of the inequality):
   \[
   9 > x \quad \text{or} \quad x < 9
   \]

Next, we will solve the second part of the inequality \(\frac{3}{x} < \frac{3}{4}\).

2. Rearranging this inequality gives us:
   \[
   3 < \frac{3}{4} x
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\) (which is positive):
   \[
   4 < x \quad \text{or} \quad x > 4
   \]

Now we have two inequalities:
- \(x < 9\)
- \(x > 4\)

Combining these gives us:
\[
4 < x < 9
\]

Next, we will find the integer values of \(x\) that satisfy this combined inequality. The integers that lie between 4 and 9 are 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's sum these integer values:
\[
5 + 6 + 7 + 8
\]

I will calculate this sum.

Executing code:
sum([5, 6, 7, 8])

Result: 26
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The sum of the integer values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality \(4 < x < 9\) is \(26\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{26}\). I hope it is correct.
