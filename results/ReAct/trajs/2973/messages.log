How many ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ of rational numbers are there where $a,b,c$ are the roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0?$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the number of ordered triplets \((a,b,c)\) of rational numbers such that \(a,b,c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), we can use Vieta's formulas. 

According to Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial \(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0\), if \(r_1, r_2, r_3\) are the roots, then:

1. \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -p\)
2. \(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = q\)
3. \(r_1r_2r_3 = -r\)

In our case, the roots are \(a, b, c\), and the polynomial can be rewritten as:

\[
x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

From Vieta's formulas, we have:

1. \(a + b + c = -a\)
2. \(ab + ac + bc = b\)
3. \(abc = -c\)

Now, we can rearrange these equations to express \(a, b, c\) in terms of each other. 

Starting with the first equation:

\[
a + b + c = -a \implies 2a + b + c = 0 \implies b + c = -2a
\]

Next, substituting \(b + c\) into the second equation:

\[
ab + ac + bc = b
\]

Substituting \(c = -2a - b\) into this equation will help us express everything in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). 

Let's perform this substitution and simplify. 

First, we will express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
c = -2a - b
\]

Now substituting \(c\) into the second equation:

\[
ab + a(-2a - b) + b(-2a - b) = b
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

After substituting \(c = -2a - b\) into the second equation, we simplified it to:

\[
-2a^2 - 2ab - b^2 - b = 0
\]

Now, we can rearrange this equation to express it in a standard quadratic form:

\[
2a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + b = 0
\]

Next, we can treat this as a quadratic equation in \(a\):

\[
2a^2 + (2b)a + (b^2 + b) = 0
\]

To find the values of \(a\), we will use the quadratic formula:

\[
a = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
\]

where \(A = 2\), \(B = 2b\), and \(C = b^2 + b\). 

Let's calculate the discriminant \(D = B^2 - 4AC\) to determine the conditions under which \(a\) is rational.

A = 2
B = 2*b
C = b**2 + b
D = B**2 - 4*A*C
D
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:


A = 2
B = 2*b
C = b**2 + b
D = B**2 - 4*A*C
D

Result: -4*b**2 - 8*b
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The discriminant \(D\) is given by:

\[
D = -4b^2 - 8b
\]

For \(a\) to be rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. We can factor \(D\):

\[
D = -4(b^2 + 2b) = -4(b(b + 2))
\]

Since \(D\) is negative for all rational \(b\) (except when \(b = 0\) or \(b = -2\)), it indicates that there are no real (and hence no rational) solutions for \(a\) when \(b\) is any rational number other than those specific values.

Now, let's check the cases when \(b = 0\) and \(b = -2\):

1. **For \(b = 0\)**:
   \[
   2a^2 + 0 + 0 = 0 \implies a = 0
   \]
   Then \(c = -2a - b = 0\). So, we have the triplet \((0, 0, 0)\).

2. **For \(b = -2\)**:
   \[
   2a^2 - 4a + 0 = 0 \implies a(a - 2) = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } a = 2
   \]
   - If \(a = 0\), then \(c = -2 - 0 = -2\), giving the triplet \((0, -2, -2)\).
   - If \(a = 2\), then \(c = -2(2) - (-2) = -4 + 2 = -2\), giving the triplet \((2, -2, -2)\).

Thus, the valid ordered triplets are:
1. \((0, 0, 0)\)
2. \((0, -2, -2)\)
3. \((2, -2, -2)\)

In total, we have found 3 ordered triplets of rational numbers \((a, b, c)\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\). I hope it is correct.
