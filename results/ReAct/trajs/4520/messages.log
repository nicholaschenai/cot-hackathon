## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Compute $\sin 90^\circ$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To compute \(\sin 90^\circ\), I recall that the sine function gives the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. At \(90^\circ\), the opposite side is equal to the hypotenuse, which means that \(\sin 90^\circ\) should equal 1.

Now, I will confirm this using the sympy library. 

Let's execute the code to find \(\sin 90^\circ\).
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_A5ukXTzCZD4R1ORYz9ioSOkv)
 Call ID: call_A5ukXTzCZD4R1ORYz9ioSOkv
  Args:
    code: import sympy as sp; sp.sin(sp.rad(90))
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

sp.sin(sp.rad(90))

Result: 1
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The calculation confirms that \(\sin 90^\circ = 1\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1}\). I hope it is correct.
