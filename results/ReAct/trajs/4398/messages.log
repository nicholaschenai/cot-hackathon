## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Find $3.72\times 1000$.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem \(3.72 \times 1000\), I will first think about how multiplying by 1000 affects the decimal number. Multiplying by 1000 is equivalent to moving the decimal point three places to the right.

Now, I will perform the multiplication using sympy to confirm the result.
Tool Calls:
  sympy_execute (call_3WvPO5IziKUznlCXnGX5Vfmu)
 Call ID: call_3WvPO5IziKUznlCXnGX5Vfmu
  Args:
    code: 3.72 * 1000
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:
3.72 * 1000

Result: 3720.0
================================== Ai Message ==================================

After performing the multiplication, I found that \(3.72 \times 1000 = 3720.0\).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{3720}\). I hope it is correct.
