## Instruction
You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

Where [answer] is just the final number or expression that solves the problem.

Let $S$ be the set of points $z$ in the complex plane such that $|z - 7 + 10i| \le 5.$  Find the area of $S.$
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The given inequality \( |z - 7 + 10i| \le 5 \) describes a disk in the complex plane. The center of the disk is at the point \( 7 - 10i \) (which corresponds to the complex number \( 7 + 10i \)), and the radius of the disk is \( 5 \).

To find the area of the disk, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi r^2
\]

where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. 

In this case, the radius \( r \) is \( 5 \). 

Next, we will calculate the area using this formula. 

Let's compute \( \pi \times 5^2 \).

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

r = 5
area = sp.pi * r**2
area

Result: 25*pi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The area of the disk \( S \) is \( 25\pi \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{25\pi}\). I hope it is correct.
