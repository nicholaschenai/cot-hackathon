You will be given a math problem.

Do not solve the problem in one go. Rather, solve it step by step.
Your next reply should either be a new step, or a conclusion that solves the entire problem.

For each step, first write down your thoughts from the previous observation, 
then use the `sympy_execute` tool to execute sympy code.

When you are done, conclude with:

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{answer}$. I hope it is correct.

When the positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are listed in ascending order, what is the fifth number listed?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the positive integers with exactly three positive divisors, we need to understand the conditions under which a number has exactly three divisors. 

A number \( n \) has exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because if \( n = p^2 \) where \( p \) is a prime, the divisors of \( n \) are \( 1, p, \) and \( p^2 \), which totals three.

Next, we need to identify the first few prime numbers, square them, and then list those squares in ascending order to find the fifth number.

Let's start by listing the first few prime numbers and calculating their squares. The first few primes are \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \) and \( 13 \). 

Now, I will calculate the squares of these primes.

Name: sympy_execute

Executing code:

primes = list(primerange(1, 20))
squares = [p**2 for p in primes]
squares

Result: [4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361]
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The squares of the first few prime numbers are:

- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 7^2 = 49 \)
- \( 11^2 = 121 \)
- \( 13^2 = 169 \)
- \( 17^2 = 289 \)
- \( 19^2 = 361 \)

Now, let's list these squares in ascending order:

1. \( 4 \)
2. \( 9 \)
3. \( 25 \)
4. \( 49 \)
5. \( 121 \)

The fifth number in this list is \( 121 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{121}$. I hope it is correct.
