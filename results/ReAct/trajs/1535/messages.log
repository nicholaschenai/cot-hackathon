================================ Human Message =================================

Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\$1$ and one ball labeled $\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\$8$ and one ball labeled $\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To find the expected win from this game, we need to break down the problem into steps based on the selection process.

1. **Determine the probabilities of selecting each ball from Bin A**:
   - Bin A has 1 white ball and 4 black balls, making a total of 5 balls.
   - The probability of selecting the white ball \( P(W) \) is \( \frac{1}{5} \).
   - The probability of selecting a black ball \( P(B) \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \).

2. **Calculate the expected win if a black ball is selected from Bin A**:
   - If a black ball is selected, we then select a ball from Bin B, which has 3 balls labeled \$1 and 1 ball labeled \$7.
   - The probabilities for Bin B are:
     - \( P(\$1) = \frac{3}{4} \)
     - \( P(\$7) = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - The expected win from Bin B can be calculated as:
     \[
     E_B = P(\$1) \cdot 1 + P(\$7) \cdot 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the expected win if the white ball is selected from Bin A**:
   - If the white ball is selected, we then select a ball from Bin W, which has 5 balls labeled \$8 and 1 ball labeled \$500.
   - The probabilities for Bin W are:
     - \( P(\$8) = \frac{5}{6} \)
     - \( P(\$500) = \frac{1}{6} \)
   - The expected win from Bin W can be calculated as:
     \[
     E_W = P(\$8) \cdot 8 + P(\$500) \cdot 500
     \]

Next, I will calculate \( E_B \) and \( E_W \).

Result: 5/2
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The expected win from Bin B, \( E_B \), is \( \frac{5}{2} \) or \$2.50.

Next, I will calculate \( E_W \) for the expected win from Bin W.

E_W

E_W

Result: 90
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The expected win from Bin W, \( E_W \), is \$90.

Now, we can combine these results to find the overall expected win from the game. The total expected win \( E \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
E = P(B) \cdot E_B + P(W) \cdot E_W
\]

Where:
- \( P(B) = \frac{4}{5} \) (probability of selecting a black ball from Bin A)
- \( P(W) = \frac{1}{5} \) (probability of selecting the white ball from Bin A)

Now, I will calculate \( E \).

Result: 20
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The overall expected win from the game is \$20.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{20}\). I hope it is correct.
