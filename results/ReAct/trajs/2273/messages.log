In the coordinate plane, let $F = (4,0).$  Let $P$ be a point, and let $Q$ be the projection of the point $P$ onto the line $x = \frac{25}{4}.$  The point $P$ traces a curve in the plane, so that
\[\frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5}\]for all points $P$ on the curve.  Find the area of the region formed by the curve.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information. We have a fixed point \( F = (4, 0) \) and a vertical line \( x = \frac{25}{4} \). The point \( P \) can be represented as \( P = (x_P, y_P) \), and the projection of \( P \) onto the line is \( Q = \left(\frac{25}{4}, y_P\right) \).

The relationship given is:

\[
\frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Next, we need to express the distances \( PF \) and \( PQ \) in terms of the coordinates of \( P \).

1. **Calculate \( PF \)**:
   The distance \( PF \) can be calculated using the distance formula:

   \[
   PF = \sqrt{(x_P - 4)^2 + (y_P - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x_P - 4)^2 + y_P^2}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( PQ \)**:
   The distance \( PQ \) is the horizontal distance between \( P \) and \( Q \):

   \[
   PQ = \sqrt{\left(x_P - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2 + (y_P - y_P)^2} = \left| x_P - \frac{25}{4} \right|
   \]

Now we can substitute these distances into the given ratio:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(x_P - 4)^2 + y_P^2}}{\left| x_P - \frac{25}{4} \right|} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Next, we will square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
\frac{(x_P - 4)^2 + y_P^2}{\left( x_P - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2} = \frac{16}{25}
\]

Now, we can cross-multiply to simplify the equation:

\[
25 \left( (x_P - 4)^2 + y_P^2 \right) = 16 \left( x_P - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2
\]

Next, we will expand both sides of the equation. 

Let's first expand the left side:

\[
25 \left( (x_P - 4)^2 + y_P^2 \right) = 25(x_P^2 - 8x_P + 16 + y_P^2) = 25x_P^2 - 200x_P + 400 + 25y_P^2
\]

Now, we expand the right side:

\[
16 \left( x_P - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 = 16 \left( x_P^2 - \frac{25}{2}x_P + \frac{625}{16} \right) = 16x_P^2 - 200x_P + 625
\]

Now we can set the two sides equal to each other:

\[
25x_P^2 - 200x_P + 400 + 25y_P^2 = 16x_P^2 - 200x_P + 625
\]

Next, we will simplify this equation:

\[
(25x_P^2 - 16x_P^2) + 25y_P^2 + (200x_P - 200x_P) + (400 - 625) = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9x_P^2 + 25y_P^2 - 225 = 0
\]

Rearranging gives us:

\[
9x_P^2 + 25y_P^2 = 225
\]

Dividing through by 225 gives:

\[
\frac{x_P^2}{25} + \frac{y_P^2}{9} = 1
\]

This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis \( 5 \) (along the x-axis) and semi-minor axis \( 3 \) (along the y-axis).

To find the area of the ellipse, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times a \times b
\]

where \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 3 \).

Now, we can calculate the area:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times 5 \times 3 = 15\pi
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{15\pi}\). I hope it is correct.
