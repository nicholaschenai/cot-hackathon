For each real number $x$, let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the greatest integer that does not exceed $x$. For how many positive integers $n$ is it true that $n<1000$ and that $\lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor$ is a positive even integer?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To solve the problem, we need to find the positive integers \( n \) such that \( n < 1000 \) and \( \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \) is a positive even integer.

First, let's denote \( k = \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \). The condition that \( k \) is a positive even integer means that \( k \) can take values like \( 2, 4, 6, \ldots \).

Next, we need to express the range of \( n \) for each even integer \( k \):

1. If \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   2 \leq \log_{2} n < 3 \implies 2^2 \leq n < 2^3 \implies 4 \leq n < 8
   \]
   The integers in this range are \( 4, 5, 6, 7 \) (4 integers).

2. If \( k = 4 \):
   \[
   4 \leq \log_{2} n < 5 \implies 2^4 \leq n < 2^5 \implies 16 \leq n < 32
   \]
   The integers in this range are \( 16, 17, \ldots, 31 \) (16 integers).

3. If \( k = 6 \):
   \[
   6 \leq \log_{2} n < 7 \implies 2^6 \leq n < 2^7 \implies 64 \leq n < 128
   \]
   The integers in this range are \( 64, 65, \ldots, 127 \) (64 integers).

4. If \( k = 8 \):
   \[
   8 \leq \log_{2} n < 9 \implies 2^8 \leq n < 2^9 \implies 256 \leq n < 512
   \]
   The integers in this range are \( 256, 257, \ldots, 511 \) (256 integers).

5. If \( k = 10 \):
   \[
   10 \leq \log_{2} n < 11 \implies 2^{10} \leq n < 2^{11} \implies 1024 \leq n < 2048
   \]
   However, since we need \( n < 1000 \), this range does not contribute any integers.

Now, we can sum the counts of integers for each valid \( k \):

- For \( k = 2 \): 4 integers
- For \( k = 4 \): 16 integers
- For \( k = 6 \): 64 integers
- For \( k = 8 \): 256 integers

Now, let's calculate the total:

\[
4 + 16 + 64 + 256
\]

Next, I will perform the calculation.

Result: 340
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The total number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n < 1000 \) and \( \lfloor \log_{2} n \rfloor \) is a positive even integer is \( 340 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{340}\). I hope it is correct.
